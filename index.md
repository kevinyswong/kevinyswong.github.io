I found myself on a college campus last night, sitting on a bench overlooking a
small stream and a footbridge crossing over towards the dorms. It was an
evening in late summer, still humid and balmy, the skies dark, the scenery
illuminated by the light from the buildings on the other side—the first week of
classes, before students settle into coursework and routines. Around me was a
palpable atmosphere of anticipation and eagerness for the semester ahead.
Gazing at the comings and goings of the students, I was sitting and reflecting
on the passing of time, on the growing distance between me and the next
generation, how I am having less and less in common with these new faces who
are just starting their lives. A group of friends walked by, and a young lass
asked if I was okay. Of course I was, I responded, springing up with a glowing
smile. After they passed, I mused: why the question? Did I look morose, just
entertaining my thoughts as is my custom? But at least she didn't call me a
darling, as I have been in the past by folks who must have mistaken my
starry-eyed, demure, and slightly off-kilter demeanor for a tame youth's
innocence.

Last year, someone shared with me an episode from the Poem-a-Day podcast. In it,
Tiana Clark reads her poem, AFTER THE READING, which is about the moments after
a poetry reading when a part of the audience comes up to converse with the
poet. I didn't make much of the poem at the time, as it wasn't the kind of
poetry I tend to enjoy, but after the passing of some recent events, today I
listened again, and how differently the poem hits. I recall something a
writer—maybe Zadie Smith?—said in an interview to the effect of: "When I was
young I was a know-it-all. Now that I'm older, I think I know very little."

<span id="Cornel-West-and-Robert-George"></span>
  I wish to ground this political discussion with a tempered start, as topics of
  this nature tend to raise tensions that easily get carried away.
  <a href="https://utsnyc.edu/faculty/cornel-west/">Cornel West</a>
  and
  <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/robert-p-george">Robert George</a>,
  ideologically and racially separate but still having maintained a friendship
  over many years, had a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUSxkKSAbbs">discussion</a>
  last year at Southern Methodist University, speaking about the importance of
  listening, openness, coming together in spite of differences, humility,
  remaining self-critical, and speaking honesty to both others' and especially
  one's own community. They're both Christian, which I am not, and George
  mentions multiple times man being the dust of the earth, which I agree with,
  and the two of them repeatedly stress the fallibility of human nature and the
  need to continually regenerate a sense of propriety and humility, which I am
  also in agreement with. It's comforting to watch and regain perspective in the
  midst of the current climate of polarization, to see that it's possible to have
  civil dialogue and grow from it despite deep disagreement in views. George
  says:
  <blockquote>
  It's tribalism that makes me think that if I'm a conservative, I must believe X.
  That's not how it should work. You should believe what you believe because you
  think the reasons for believing it are best, and then you'll see what that
  makes you in the parlance of the day. Notice how different that is from first
  choosing your box and then choosing your beliefs depending on what's in the
  box.
  </blockquote>
  Elsewhere, West says, "I'm a blues man. There's no optimism in the blues."
  Elaborating further, West says:
  <blockquote>
  Well, I come from a people who've been terrorized, traumatized, and stigmatized
  for four hundred years so we've had to come to terms with catastrophe on a
  variety of different levels, psychic, social—when you hear John Coltrane's LOVE
  SUPREME, when you hear Nina Simone, when you hear Luther King Jr., what do you
  see? In the face of catastrophe, compassion, courage, vision—not hatred, not
  revenge—compassion, courage.
  </blockquote>
  And he then talks about B.B. King "playing with Lucille [his guitar]"—"B.B., how
  you do it? where you get that smile, where you get that style, B.B., don't you
  realize you in the face of catastrophe, we know you come outta gut-bucket Jim
  Crow Mississippi but you still got that hope in you but you don't talk about
  the hope, you enact the hope and it's in your music, that is the blues."

  The blues captures the sentiment of this piece. The writer realized at some
  point while writing it that some of parts of his composition may read as
  accusatory, whose comments seem acerbic. The writer has no intention to slander
  or defame, but if any of the implied foibles of others hold true, the writer
  too is not free of blame. The writer's intention is to portray his views on
  these issues as he understands, within the limits of his powers, with a
  generous latitude for honesty, faithful to fact and reason, with the aim of
  depicting some semblance of truth. Where the reader feels the writing is lofty,
  that may indeed be an accurate interpretation, but where the reader comes
  across a pointed remark, then that may also be an apt rendition of the current
  affairs, and something of a reminder of honesty may be of use, and when it
  comes to matters of seeking clarity and truth, the writer feels more obliged to
  pulling up the curtain concealing deceit than let the audience rest in comfort
  watching a misguiding puppet show. The writer makes no claim to possess
  knowledge of the whole truth but hopes this piece points in its direction and
  suggests its general contour, even if vaguely. If the writer were to condense
  this piece into one statement, it is this: we know quite a bit less than our
  pride has convinced us. Rather than unrealistic idealism, let us work with the
  reality we have before our eyes while also keeping our wits about us.

<u id="currid-halkett">Peace: Currid-Halkett</u><br>

  As I mentioned, let's start slow, before the discussion gets heated and my
  comments take a criticizing turn, which springs from my view that we should aim
  towards truth and away from self-conceit. This first section commences from the
  spirit of unity, of reminding us that the country, across divides, remain
  considerably similar and have much in common.
  <a href="https://priceschool.usc.edu/people/elizabeth-currid/">Elizabeth Currid-Halkett</a>
  published a book last year, THE OVERLOOKED AMERICANS, about her research on
  rural America, and the Americans her title refers to are the prosperous ones
  living there who have been neglected in the dominant liberal narrative of a
  decaying, languishing, and emptying countryside. Through a combination of
  interviews and data analysis, Currid-Halkett's findings show that, in spite of
  the perception of a wide gap, rural and urban Americans are remarkably similar
  on many measures, from political opinions, attitudes towards equality, stance
  on democracy, household income, employment rates, homeownership rates, life
  satisfaction, and religiosity. In Currid-Halkett's view, what is driving the
  perceived divide is mainstream media, motivated by clicks, heightened stimuli,
  alarming headlines, in effect amplifying a sense of political divide.

  Currid-Halkett writes that although the common perception is that educated
  citizens value diversity, tolerance, and openness more than those less
  educated, it is in fact the least educated groups (those who have not finished
  high school) that have the most support for racial diversity, according to data
  from the General Social Survey in 2018. Specifically, when asked the
  question, "Should government aid Blacks?", among those with less than a high
  school education, 26.6% of urban respondents agreed, as did 23.1% of rural
  respondents (note the similarity of these two numbers)—as opposed to those with
  at least a college degree, of whom 19.8% of urban respondents and 21.4% of
  rural respondents agreed (again, note the similarity. The data sets
  Currid-Halkett reference in the book consistently display these urban-rural
  matches when responses have been grouped by other variables like general
  attitudes, race, or education, which helps her conclude that there isn't an
  actual divide in the country between geographic red and blue, which is commonly
  portrayed in the predominant narrative as a major reason for the current state
  of political polarization). Currid-Halkett remarks that it is certainly true
  that educated folks support racial integration policies, but the support is
  only in the abstract, quickly faltering when it comes to applied policies. She
  cites a 1978
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2110618">paper</a>
  by sociologist
  <a href="https://sociology.ucdavis.edu/people/mary-jackman">Mary Jackman</a>,
  from which I obtain a summarizing quote:
  <blockquote>
  Increasing years of education lead to a greater familiarity with the appropriate
  democratic position on racial integration but not to a stronger commitment to
  racial integration . . . I am <i>not</i> arguing that the well educated lie to
  the interviewer in order to present themselves in the best light whenever they
  can readily recognize that a democratic principle constitutes the substance of
  a question. The process is probably more subtle. The well educated are more
  likely to have genuinely "learned" abstract democratic principles, but that
  learning is relatively superficial. When democratic principles are contemplated
  in isolation from other factors, the well educated are more likely to recognize
  those principles, to know the "right" answers, and to believe sincerely in
  those answers . . . As a result, they are more likely to support democratic
  principles in the abstract, but they are no more likely to call on those
  principles in an applied situation than is anyone else.
  </blockquote>
  Currid-Halkett, finding corroborating studies in more recent years, cites this
  2003 Pew
  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2003/05/14/conflicted-views-of-affirmative-action/">survey</a>
  and this 2020 Gallup
  <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/317006/affirmative-action-public-opinion.aspx">article</a>
  on the disparity in support between abstract principles and concrete policy.
  Currid-Halkett's point is that obstructions to racial progress exist, but they
  exist in both rural and urban America at similar rates when it comes to actual
  corrective measures and government action.

  Although Republicans and Democrats may have more in common than popular
  conception permits and certainly more than the polarized perception propagated
  by media outlets, the people drawn to each party, because of this decision,
  have their differences—what are they? Here I take issue with Currid-Halkett's
  inclination to seek connection, pushing out space for differences.
  Currid-Halkett at the outset explicitly states that her intention is to find
  similarities and shared humanity across the red-blue geographic divide. A more
  appropriate approach is to make no assumption and investigate from there, open
  to however the results turn out, and if intractable differences are found, then
  the differences are simply the fact of the matter, not to be glossed over by
  countervailing liberal sympathies, wishful thinking, and unrealistic ideals for
  everything under the sky. I find it slightly irritating that she seems naively
  impressed by simple realities, overstating cliche truisms, making it sound like
  discovering a sense of common humanity among rural American is a holy grail
  that has never before occurred to anyone, so taken aback from realizing that
  other people are, in fact, people that she neglects to point out that had she
  studied common folks in any country, she'd likely reach similar mind-blowing
  revelations. I don't think she's unintelligent so much as she succumbs to the
  charming but flimsy vogue of "sympathy and kindness solve all the world's
  problems." But this particular qualm of mine is not important, as it is but an
  exhale from one innocent reader who simply wishes to disburden himself of all
  the disbelief and frustration he has accumulated over the course of the book's
  earth-shattering sentiments over what are, plainly, common sense. I understand
  her attempt to lift the veil of the liberal urbanite's condemning image of
  rural America, but when she keeps repeating that she wants to uncover the deep
  story, of which she continually emphasizes the "deep", to reach out to a shared
  comaraderie, to stumble upon the "profound commonalities of the human
  condition", to discover in connecting genuinely with her interviewees that she
  ends up liking them: look how human they are in spite of their conservative
  views! They are human too! My response: "Oh my, you don't say."

  I find Currid-Halkett's results on income parity between cities and the
  countryside surprising. In particular, she concludes from her data analysis:
  <blockquote>
  Median income levels in rural America are almost the same as urban America. And
  despite urban Americans becoming more educated from 1990 to 2019, the gap
  between urban and rural median income has been closing over the same period. In
  2019, the difference in median income levels beteen urban and rural populations
  was just $10,642 per year (this figure is in 2020 dollars) . . . Controlling for
  cost of living, that $10,642 advantage dwindles down to nothing.
  </blockquote>
  Yet, how has such an important equivalence been unknown to most people to now
  suddenly be discovered by Currid-Halkett? Have the data all along been covering
  up this hidden reality? Her analysis uses median household income but according
  to the book END TIMES by
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W0C05zIAAAAJ&hl=en">Peter Turchin</a>,
  which I discuss in the next section, suggests that this metric can be
  misleading, describing the scenario of a hypothetical family:
  <blockquote>
  [A]lthough the combined income of Steve and his mom in 2016 was greater than
  what his dad earned back in 1976, this was due to both members of the household
  working. Steve's mom works at Walmart not because she enjoys the experience but
  simply because they wouldn't be able to pay the bills without her earnings. The
  increase in their household income was not accompanied by an increase in her
  quality of life. It merely enabled them not to fall behind.
  </blockquote>
  This scenario opens up a broader array of reasons behind the rise in median
  household income: continuing to work after the retirement years against one's
  original plans, working more jobs than usual, more members in the household
  working who ordinarily wouldn't be. I am not saying Currid-Halkett's results
  are impossible; I am merely exercising a healthy dose of skepticism and am
  holding off belief until further research and thirty-party confirmation.
  Considering Currid-Halkett's preconceived mission to find the common humanity
  among rural Americans in her interviews, I wonder if she brought the same
  corrective halo into her demographic analysis. How is it that economists, who
  work more often with income data, have not come across this surprising income
  parity, and that it is Currid-Halkett, descending with an angelic calling, to
  stumble on a finding that runs contrary to the conventional understanding that
  urban jobs tend to have higher salaries? Perhaps all of us are due for a
  reminder that facts, clarity, and truth are independent of our sentiments, and
  reality is apathetic to our feelings. Truth ought to be confronted as it is,
  and our responses to it should ensue, not preordain. I'm aware that the quest
  towards truth can often be long and controversial, and multiple versions can
  coexist depending on perspective, and that every person is not immune from
  subjective prejudice, cognitive convenience, and experiential lapses brought to
  the table to then get mixed with the individual's skewed lenses peering at
  reality. Each person's truth is perhaps an inextricable blend of actual fact
  with the person's values, ideals, projections, and prior experience. Frances
  Wickes writes in her 1938 book, THE INNER WORLD OF MAN:
  <blockquote>
  Our concepts of life are combinations of objective reality and subjective
  attitude. In this way our world becomes peopled not by human beings as they
  really are, but by images of our own conceiving. Two daughters may describe a
  mother in such varying terms that you feel they must be talking of two
  different individuals. They have described not the parent but a parental image.
  Two people (a golfing friend and an employee) describe a man to us, and their
  descriptions bear little resemblance to each other. We meet him and the image
  we form of him differs from either of the others. Which is the image of
  reality? Where does the truth lie? We realize that in each case the person is
  telling the truth as he sees it, he is describing an image that to him
  expresses the reality of this person. Our personal experiences and our
  temperamental prejudices are continually at work forming images, not only of
  people but of ideals and concepts, by which we judge, evaluate and determine
  much of our conscious life. Nor is the image a mere psychic reproduction of an
  objective reality. Into its formation enter the emotions, the personal
  reactions, and the imaginative concepts about the object. All these elements
  combine to form an image which is a blending of the objective and the
  subjective. How much this image conforms to outer reality depends upon the
  psychic background of the individual . . . An increased understanding of these
  images moving in the unconscious gives one a chance to reckon with them with
  greater clarity and have more understanding of our real motives and desires. It
  would be convenient if the images marched along in the order given, but
  unfortunately they do nothing of the sort.
  </blockquote>
  At least when it comes to data and numbers, which admittedly can certainly be
  molded and cut preferentially or incorrectly, subjective leanings can be
  chipped away in the search for truth. With such an income analysis as
  Currid-Halkett's, we ought to make the attempt.

  As a further note of my critique, my comments here perhaps verging on pedantry,
  Currid-Halkett inaccurately writes, "Rousseau argued that the root of
  inequality was not 'natural inequality' (for example, physical strength) but
  rather 'moral inequality' as a result of human decisions made in a civil
  society." This statement of hers doesn't seem to be the correct interpretation.
  Rousseau in DISCOURSE ON THE ORIGIN AND FOUNDATIONS OF INEQUALITY AMONG
  MANKIND, his Second Discourse, claims it was with the invention of private
  property that marked the dawn of social inequality:
  <blockquote>
  The first man, who after enclosing a piece of ground, took it into his head to
  say <i>this is mine</i>, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the
  real founder of civil society. How many crimes, how many wars, how many
  murders . . . would that man have saved the human species, who pulling up the
  stakes or filling up the ditches should have cried to his fellows: Beware of
  listening to this imposter: you are lost, if you forget that the fruits of the
  earth belong equally to us all, and the earth itself to nobody!
  </blockquote>
  In the text itself, Rousseau writes that it is both natural and moral
  inequality, not just the moral inequality that Currid-Halkett ascribes to his
  claim, that contribute to social inequality among men, his argument set upon a
  hypothetical origin of civilization:
  <blockquote>
  In proportion as ideas and feelings succeed each other, and the head and the
  heart become active, men continue to shake off their original wildness, and
  their connections become more intimate and extensive. They now began to
  assemble round a great tree: singing and dancing, the genuine offspring of love
  and leisure . . . Everyone began to notice the rest, and wished to be noticed
  himself; and public esteem acquired a value. He who sang or danced best; the
  handsomest, the strongest, the most dexterous, or the most eloquent, came to be
  the most respected: this was the first step towards inequality, and at the same
  time towards vice. From these first distinctions there arose on one side vanity
  and contempt, on the other envy and shame; and the fermentation caused by these
  new leavens at length produced combinations fatal to happiness and
  innocence . . . Things thus circumstanced might have remained equal, if men's
  talents had been equal, and if, for instance, the use of iron and the
  consumption of commodities had always held an exact proportion to each other;
  but as nothing preserved this balance, it was soon broken. The man that had the
  most strength performed the most labor; the most dextrous turned his labor to
  best account; the most ingenious found out methods of lessening his labor; the
  husbandman required more iron, or the smith more grain, and while both worked
  equally, one earned a great deal by his labor, while the other could scarcely
  live by his. Thus natural inequality insensibly unfolds itself with that
  arising from men's combining, and the differences among men, developed by the
  differences of their circumstances, become more noticeable, more permanent in
  their effects, and begin to influence in the same proportion the condition of
  individuals.
  </blockquote>
  Prudently, Rousseau goes on to lament the regrettable outcome of inequality:
  <blockquote>
  From the vast inequality of conditions and fortunes, from the great variety of
  passions and of talents, of useless arts, of pernicious arts, of frivolous
  sciences, would issue clouds of prejudices equally contrary to reason, to
  happiness, to virtue. We should see the chiefs foment everything that tends to
  weaken men united in societies by dividing them; everything that, while it
  gives society an air of apparent harmony, sows in it the seeds of real
  dissension; everything that can inspire the different classes with mutual
  distrust and hatred by an opposition of their rights and interests, and so
  strengthen that power which controls them all.
  </blockquote>
  I will return later to this work from Rousseau when I discuss inequality in
  greater detail.

  A thought: humans are vain and self-interested, preferring to consume media
  which flatter their self-image. They are drawn to simplified explanations and
  conform to the views of their peers. They prefer news that idolize their side
  and diminish the other. Media, in turn, drawn to clicks and profit, give
  viewers what they want, in effect amplifying political issues and cover
  sensational issues more extensively than their prevalence in reality,
  exaggerating the sense of divide, creating a reductive image of the other side
  as a stereotypical caricature, an easy recipient of blame, that though each
  side is in the same country, they have little personal contact with the other,
  digesting only their affiliation's media and cementing into their perceived
  reality the uncomplimentary views of the other. How to incentivize
  truth-seeking? How to steer people away from self-flattery?

  Most folks may simply not value politics all that much, and issues of race,
  gender, religion, abortion, though highly publicized in media, which may
  benefit from emphasizing such tribalism to attract viewership, are not
  significant components in daily life for most people, liberal or conservative,
  all of whom may just prefer to go about their business and mind their private
  matters. If asked, and if they'll answer honestly, people will reveal their
  views, but for the most part the questions themselves are not more important
  than asking whether someone prefers creamy or crunchy peanut butter. Most folks
  may simply be apathetic to issues related to identity politics. Those issues
  may just not matter all that much, and the perception that they do may stem
  from media's obsession over them and politicians riding the heated wave in
  their campaigns. These claims of mine, of course, come with the caveat that
  they pertain to daily matters and casual interactions, not the more
  consequential interfaces when it comes to changes in the public school
  curriculum, college admissions, job promotions, entrenched segregation in
  housing, and all other sorts of enduring divides where such issues very much
  remain relevant, and in sustained relations where certain demographic
  associations play a part, albeit subtly, but such factors exist in red country
  just as much as in urban liberal bastions, which offer a more modern and
  tolerant facade but underneath may not be all that different. I'll return to
  this last point later; as I said, I'll start slow and ground the discussion on
  a tempered foundation. For the predominant news providers to sustain these
  issues as a matter of national discourse and continually remind the public of
  divisive issues does the country a major disservice. Liberal media buoys
  liberal insularity, and conservative media exaggerates national threats and
  chaos, and when a conservative encounters a known liberal, the conservative
  brings grudges from the outset, but for that matter so will the liberal, and
  what results is an interaction of stereotypes received from media rather than
  of reality. I suspect many folks don't enjoy thinking about politics which is
  not a priority in their lives so long as political troubles don't impinge on
  them, yet when politics come up in conversation, the heated tension from
  accumulated exposure to divisive news on each side elicits a reactionary anger
  to what may otherwise not matter all that much. I make this next statement with
  the usual disclaimer that no generalization applies to everyone, and individual
  differences may vary greatly within any category: let me suggest to liberals
  that the label "Republican" of many such folks may not mean what liberals think
  it means, that the distance may not be that large, that people are people like
  all others who have their differences. And on that note, again to liberals, the
  terms "Democrat", "progressive", and even "liberal" may not mean the allyship
  such labels bring to mind, that they may be only surface identifiers that grant
  favor to those who, through education, have learned to play officialdom's game
  and who benefit from the prevailing social climate, who may even have convinced
  themselves of the ideals but who then gracefully forget to extend those ideals
  into policy and action, that when they discover the personal cost and
  difficulty of following through with their words, it is with a curious, if
  predictably consistent, case of sudden cold feet that they recuse themselves,
  inexplicably awe-struck by the terms of reality that their hitherto righteous
  energy and loud protests collapse into a muted sound one might mistake for
  silence were it not for the crickets. But I have digressed; let me return to
  the grounded state! You tell me this not humorous, that I am failing my
  mission! Please do forgive moi! Allow me try once more!

  I don't mean to unduly criticize Currid-Halkett, from whose book I've learned a
  few things. Yet Currid-Halkett, well-educated, mature, only seven or eight
  decades younger than me, is a mother of three, so I can fairly assume she is
  strong enough to take honest feedback and maybe a joke here and especially
  later on, that she can dare to laugh at herself and her fellow liberals. As
  Lucian Freud observed of Sigmund Freud:
  <blockquote>
  He always seemed to be in a good mood. He had what many <i>really</i>
  intelligent people have, which is not being serious or solemn. They <i>know</i>
  what they are talking about so they have no need to be earnest about it.
  </blockquote>
  We must humor ourselves with a historic name whose life and fortune ran afoul in
  incredible jest! Currid-Halkett writes, "In the Enlightenment, Voltaire and
  Rousseau had equal footing." But this is the sort of false perception caused by
  a retrospective rose-tinted lenses along the lines of: "Rousseau's ideas have
  proved influential; therefore he must have been popular and well-received in
  his time." This was not true. Voltaire, an aristocrat, was hostile and
  antagonistic to Rousseau and his upstart ideas. Rousseau, though well-known
  then and now, was for the most part infamous during his lifetime. It was with
  the French Revolution, nearly a decade after Roussea's death, a radical
  political and social upheaval priding itself on Rousseau's ideals of equality,
  that Rousseau's name was accepted into the establishment. If Rousseau has come
  to be held in high regard, this reputation stems largely only after his death,
  even if the intermission was fairly short. While Rousseau was alive, his books
  were banned; he was a fugitive for much of his life; America's founding fathers
  did not mention his influence. As
  <a href="https://english.fas.harvard.edu/people/leo-damrosch">Leo Damrosch</a>
  writes in a 2012
  <a href="https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/julyaugust/feature/friends-rousseau">article</a>
  in the Humanities magazine:
  <blockquote>
  It is always said that the American Founders were chiefly influenced by Locke
  and Montesquieu, and so they were. But some were influenced by Rousseau as
  well, though his radical reputation made it unwise to say so openly.
  Jefferson's immortal line, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
  men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain
  unalienable rights," comes directly out of <i>The Social Contract</i>,
  published two hundred and fifty years ago this year.
  </blockquote>
  His contemporary peers derided his work and ideas, and Rousseau wrote
  considerably to defend himself, largely to no avail. He struggled financially
  and especially towards the end of his life. In a 2002
  <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300091410/the-social-contract-and-the-first-and-second-discourses/">collection</a>
  of Rousseau's political writings, collated and edited by
  <a href="https://web.williams.edu/humanities/sdunn/biography/biography-index.htm">Susan Dunn</a>,
  we find a timeline in which Rousseau's later years read like a piece of comedy:
  1762-1770: "Rousseau travels from place to place, hoping to find asylum, still
  preoccupied with grievances against his friends. The city of Geneva refuses him
  asylum because of his political and religious ideas."—1765: "Voltaire calls for
  Rousseau's death. Rousseau's house in Môltiers is stoned, and he flees."—
  1767-1769: "Rousseau returns to France; he wanders clandestinely from place to
  place."—1770-1771: "After eight years of wandering, Rousseau moves to Paris,
  where he lives in poverty."—1772: "Dissatisfied with his <i>Confessions</i> and
  preoccupied with justifying and explaining himself, he begins writing
  <i>Dialogues: Rousseau[,] Judge of Jean-Jacques</i>."—1776-1778: "He works on
  his <i>Reveries of the Solitary Walker</i> . . ., a poignant, introspective
  work . . . He makes a public plea for financial help." And: "He dies on 2 July
  1778, five days after his sixty-sixth birthday." As a matter of fact,
  DIALOGUES: ROUSSEAU, JUDGE OF JEAN-JACQUES is a most curious piece of work, in
  which Rousseau is a character speaking to an unnamed Frenchman, and the subject
  of their conversation is a mysterious and obscure writer, Jean-Jacques.
  Rousseau, a rather verbose fella who never fails to deliver long, long
  paragraphs in a highly imbalanced conversation, tells the terse, inquisitive,
  and eerily persistent Frenchman seemingly immune to boredom about the pride
  Jean-Jacques has with his independence:
  <blockquote>
  True passions, which are rarer than one might think among men, become even more
  so day by day. Interest erodes them, diminishes them, swallows them all up, and
  vanity, which is only a folly of amour-propre [vain self-love], helps to stifle
  them more. The motto of Baron de Feneste can be read in big letters in all the
  actions of the men of today: <i>It is for appearances</i> . . . The man who is
  not dominated by amour-propre and who does not go seeking his happiness far
  from himself is the only one who knows heedlessness and sweet leisure, and J.J.
  is that man as far as I can determine . . . It is through laziness, through
  nonchalance, through aversion for dependency and penury that J.J. copies music.
  He does his work when and as it suits him. He is not accountable to anyone for
  his day, his time, his work, his leisure. He doesn't need to arrange anything,
  forsee anything, worry about anything; he has nothing to expend his mind on; he
  is himself and on his own all day every day.
  </blockquote>
  Is this the Rousseau of whom Currid-Halkett speaks? Is she referring to the
  popularly revered Rousseau, or is she nodding towards the defiant champion of
  himself, the Jean-Jacques, the great J.J. who insists that "he is himself and
  on his own all day every day"? For clarity, Rousseau writes in his last work,
  REVERIES OF THE SOLITARY WALKER, unfinished at the time of his death:
  <blockquote>
  These hours of solitude and meditation are the only ones in the day when I am
  completely myself and my own master, with nothing to distract or hinder me, the
  only ones when I can truly say I am what nature meant me to be . . . The
  conclusion I can draw from all these reflections is that I have never been
  truly fit for social life, where there is nothing but irksome duty and
  obligation, and that my independent character has always made it impossible for
  me to submit to the constraints which must be accepted by anyone who wishes to
  live among men.
  </blockquote>
  What a character, this Rousseau! Nevertheless, as staunchly independent as he
  was, Rousseau is important, and as I said I will return to him later. For now,
  I shall conclude this foray into Rousseau with the words of a neutral
  commentator,
  <a href="https://french.columbia.edu/content/gita-may-1929-2016">Gita May</a>,
  who makes the observation in her essay, ROUSSEAU, CULTURAL CRITIC:
  <blockquote>
  Rousseau boldly challenged the commonly held and cherished notion that great
  scientific and artistic accomplishments necessarily contribute to the
  betterment of the human condition. This meant that he would have the stand
  alone against the <i>philosophes</i> [Enlightenment philosophers], and
  especially against his friend Diderot [editor of the ENCYCLOPÉDIE, the
  centerpiece of the Enlightenment] . . . In a society with a devalued morality
  every individual becomes an actor—that is, one well-versed in the art of
  wearing a mask and in the ruses of deception . . . Rousseau deliberately set
  out to contrast the simple, frugal ways of Sparta with the high culture of
  Athens as a strong warning that as a nation grows rich and powerful and as its
  prosperity increases, it may come to give in to a fatal craving for luxury,
  urbanity, refined manners and pleasures. This narcissistic preoccupation with
  pleasure, politeness, elegance, and good taste will be fatally inimical to
  morality and to the survival of such basic, simple, and essential virtues as
  truthfulness, sincerity, loyalty, courage, humanity, and love of duty and of
  freedom.
  </blockquote>
  This incredibly pertinent foray into Rousseau notwithstanding and my critique of
  Currid-Halkett aside, let me repeat the core message of Currid-Halkett's work,
  which I stand in agreement with: most of the country's Republicans and
  Democrats, despite their apparent division and public discontent, actually have
  much in common. It is true that extremists on both sides exist, but the media
  echoes their voices, setting up one side against the other as though they are
  mortal enemies, and the effect on the public is a constant perception of
  irremediable fissure. Dissenting views between Republicans and Democrats also
  exist, but their opinions are often sensible in their circumstances, knowledge
  base, sources of trust and authority, and community, and the disagreement is
  not to the extent that they cannot exchange thoughts. Neither party is a solid
  monolith, and discord and difference also occur within.

<u id="turchin">Trouble: Turchin</u><br>

  Even though I agree with Currid-Halkett that the popular image of the red-blue
  polarization is misleading, there remains a very real problem of inequality
  that sits behind the current turmoil. We now turn to
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W0C05zIAAAAJ&hl=en">Peter Turchin</a>
  and his view on the increasingly unstable state of affairs. Let me make the
  reminder that the intention of this post is to adhere to the truth, even to
  dire depths, and I forewarn the reader that from here onwards, this post offers
  little in the way of flattery and easy gains, and much of it ventures into the
  unpleasant, but it is only by wading through the gloom that the essential
  issues can be confronted in order to reach the genuine light at the end.

  Turchin's research has focused on what has caused historical societies to
  collapse, and his book published last year, END TIMES, describes the confluence
  of the same factors that lead to societal decline. For an overview, Turchin
  gave a
  <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/events/cliodynamics-of-end-times/">talk</a>
  on the book's ideas. To get to the point: Turchin sees the circumstances today
  as a "revolutionary situation," and the two main culprits, with
  self-explanatory names, are: popular immiseration and elite overproduction.
  Turchin bases his conception of popular immiseration on the growing inequality
  shown in economic data:
  <blockquote>
  The US Census Bureau helpfully provides data on the median income. Between 1976
  and 2016, it grew from $52,621 (in 2020 dollars) to $63,683, a change of 21
  percent . . . When we look at wages, the supposed improvement in economic
  conditions is diluted . . . The median real wage between 1976 and 2016
  increased from $17.11 to $18.90 per hour—that is, by 10 percent . . . The
  average real wage of workers with bachelor's degrees increased from $27.83 to
  $34.27 per hour. (As before, I am comparing 1976 to 2016 using
  inflation-adjusted dollars.) Americans with advanced degrees did even better,
  going from $33.18 to $43.92. But workers with just high school degrees saw
  their wages decrease from $19.25 to $18.57. For workers who did not complete
  high school, wages shrank from $15.50 to $13.66 . . . The startling conclusion
  from these data is that Americans without a four-year college degree—64 percent
  of the total population—have been losing ground in absolute terms; their real
  wages shrank over the forty years before 2016.
  </blockquote>
  Then in a calculation disregarding inflation which provides a starker image:
  <blockquote>
  In 1976, the average cost of studying at a public university was $617 per year.
  That sounds almost unreal. A worker earning the median wage in 1976 needed to
  work 150 hours to earn one year of college. In 2016, the average annual cost of
  public university tuition and fees was $8,804. A median-wage worker needed to
  work 500 hours to pay for it—that's more than three times longer. The challenge
  of affording a median house tells a similar story: a median worker must work 40
  percent longer to earn it in 2016 compared to 1976. That 10 percent increase in
  real median wage starts to look even punier than before . . . In 2016, "working
  class" (less educated) [those who only completed high school] parents had to
  work four times as long to pay for college for their children compared to 1976.
  This means that the ability to move from the less educated to the more educated
  class has dramatically eroded in just a few decades.
  </blockquote>

  <a href="https://coe.arizona.edu/person/regina-j-deil-amen">Regina Deil-Amen</a>
  points out in a 2012
  <a href="https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/e_Regina%20Deil-Amen.pdf">paper</a>,
  that community college students have, based on data from the 2008-2009 academic
  year, grown to be as numerous as four-year college students, even though they
  are not represented in the image of the typical college student, calling them
  the "marginalized majority":
  <blockquote>
  Our conceptions of the typical idealized college student are based on
  traditional notions and an imagined norm of someone who begins college
  immediately after high school, enrolls full-time, lives on campus, and is ready
  to begin college-level classes . . . [F]ocusing attention on the traditional
  four-year sector as the norm is quite dismissive of a clear majority of our
  nation's students and the institutions that serve them. They are the relatively
  neglected <i>other half</i> of U.S. higher education . . . For too long, it has
  been assumed that what works for the dominant and more elite groups can work in
  underresourced contexts with differing challenges. This is simply a hypothesis
  that thus far has not been born out in reality. Resource rich school with great
  pools of upper middle class parental capital and assistance function very well
  for those students. The same structure has not been shown to function very well
  in the absence of such parental support. In fact, I would argue that our public
  schools are structured to succeed dependent upon parental resources. It makes
  litle sense to expect the same schol structures to operate effectively for
  families in low SES circumstances and their children.
  </blockquote>
  But what about those who haven't gone to college? Oliver Anthony's song,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro">RICH MEN NORTH OF RICHMOND</a>
  struck a particular chord with great portions of the country last summer, and
  based on the song's popularity, it would be neglectful not to take popular
  immiseration seriously. Encapsulating these dire economic inequalities with a
  dismal prospect, Turchin warns:
  <blockquote>
  [T]he declining well-being of the working class is a bad thing—because it
  fundamentally undermines the stability of our society. Most obviously, when
  large swaths of the population experience falling living standards, this
  undermines the legitimacy of our institutions and thus weakens the state.
  Popular immiseration increases mass mobilization potential. In the past,
  peasants revolted when their misery could not be borne anymore.
  </blockquote>
  In conjunction with popular immiseration is an even more potent factor: elite
  overproduction, as Turchin discusses:
  <blockquote>
  History (and CrisisDB [Turchin's historical database]) tells us that the
  credentialed precariat (or, in the jargon of cliodynamics, the frustrated elite
  aspirant class) is the most dangerous class for societal stability.
  Overproduction of youth with advanced degrees has been the most significant
  factor in driving societal upheavals, from the Revolutions of 1848 to the Arab
  Spring of 2011 . . . The most dangerous occupation, however, appears to be the
  legal profession . . . Let's take a closer look at what's happened to law
  school graduates in the last few decades. For many years, the National
  Association for Law Placement, NALP, has been collecting data on starting
  salaries obtained by law school graduates. In 1991, this distribution was not
  particularly remarkable . . . For the class of 2020, the left bulge flattened a
  bit, with most reported salaries between $45K and $75K, accounting for 50
  percent of reported salaries. But the right-hand peak was now $190K, with just
  over 20 percent of the distribution. There were very few salaries between the
  two peaks . . . The 20 percent . . . are well on their way to joining the
  established elites. Those who are in the lump on the left . . . are in
  trouble . . . [M]ost of them will be crushed by the debt and its relentlessly
  accumulating interest. It's strange to think of most law school graduates as
  members of the precariat, but that's what they are.
  </blockquote>
  According to Turchin, when popular immiseration and elite overproduction
  combine, what results is rising societal instability and political fracture:
  <blockquote>
  As of 2022, we are clearly in transition from the precrisis phase, when the
  state is still struggling to maintain control of the ideological landscape in
  the face of a multitude of counter-elite challengers, to the next phase, when
  numerous contenders struggle among themselves for primacy. Politicians who
  still cling to old-regime values, which emphasize moderation and intraelite
  cooperation, have been retiring, or losing elections to challengers with more
  extreme views . . . Many observers were taken aback by the intensity of
  the 'cancel culture' that appeared seemingly out of nowhere. But such vicious
  ideological struggles are a common phase in any revolution. Jacque Mallet du
  Pan . . . formulated this observation as a dictum: 'Like Saturn, the
  [French] Revolution devours its children. This is a necessary corollary,
  essentially a mathematical certainty, following from elite overproduction as
  the most important driver of rebellions, revolutions, and civil wars. In order
  for stability to return, elite overproduction somehow needs to be taken care
  of—historically and typically by eliminating the surplus elites through
  massacre, imprisonment, emigration, or forced or voluntary downward social
  mobility. In America today, the losers are treated in milder ways, at least for
  now . . . Immiserated proletarians are not the ones who run successful
  revolutions. The truly dangerous revolutionaries are frustrated elite
  aspirants, who have the privileges, training, and connections to enable them to
  wield influence at scale. Even the minority of the newly credentialed youth who
  get into elite positions right away, like the 20 percent of law school
  graduates with $190K salaries, are not happy campers, because they feel the
  general insecurity. The growing proportion of credentialed youth who are doomed
  to become the educated precariat are the ones who have nothing to lose but
  their precarity.
  </blockquote>
  Turchin likens the potency of popular immiseration as a forest and elite
  overproduction to a fire: how long has a drought been and how dense and
  overgrown are the trees? The surplus of elites is perhaps a constant, and at
  times it grows, and when only a small group of trees are in misery, only a
  negligible fire, easily put out, ensues. But when massive sections of the
  forest have been immiserated, easily swayed and influenced by
  anti-establishment alternatives of hope, the spark of a single fire expands
  outward as naturally as the wind blows: populism heralded by a potent
  counter-elite.

  My fellow Americans of this yet-again great country, we must sit ourselves down
  like schoolchildren and take a page from some mighty fine folks aspiring to
  represent you and me in our country's highest office and witness civility at
  its finest hour! Last year at the fourth Republican presidential primary
  debate, on the topic of Trump, Chris Christie and Ron DeSantis couldn't wait to
  express their eagerness on the matter and elevated themselves to simultaneous
  <a href="https://youtu.be/1PpIwZNlBAE?t=3489">talking</a>!
  The patient audience can certainly follow along with what they are saying! This
  exchange surely resembles the workings of a functioning party! But to be sure,
  the trumpy man who won the primary did not even need to show up at any of the
  party's debates to trump his trumpets! And to add salt to the wound, debased
  conduct is by no means limited to the presidential candidates! CNN shared a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey_r9lXICcM">video</a>
  of a recent verbal conflict during a hearing in a House of Representatives
  committee, with personal insults now thrown in—some real professional conduct
  that one would not find more proper in a middle-school playground. How comic!
  One may even start to wonder whether one should laugh and enjoy some comedy at
  the frustrated political divide, if only these aren't elected representatives
  in the government who should be doing their jobs and fixing the country's
  problems. More sensibly, the second half of the video is of David Frum and
  other commentators analyzing the incident and how this is behavior becoming
  more common in an increasingly dysfunctional political climate. Turchin
  writes:
  <blockquote>
  Popular discontent coupled with a large pool of elite aspirants makes for a very
  combustible combination, as we have experienced in America since 2016.
  </blockquote>
  Stepping back, Turchin reflects on the current political landscape:
  <blockquote>
  The Democratic Party . . . is now the party of the 10 percent and of the 1
  percent. But the 1 percent is losing its traditional political vehicle, the
  Republican Party, which is being taken over by its populist wing . . . Earlier
  I argued that a revolution cannot succeed without large-scale organization. The
  right-wing populists intend to use the GOP as an already existing organization
  to grasp power. An added advantage is that control of one of the main parties
  offers them a nonviolent, legal route to power.
  </blockquote>
  Putting our predicament in perspective, Turchin writes:
  <blockquote>
  The American Republic has gone through two revolutionary situations . . . The
  first one, which developed during the 1850s, was resolved by a social
  revolution, the American Civil War, which replaced the antebellum ruling elites
  with the new corporate ruling class. The second one, which peaked during the
  1920s, was resolved by the adoption of the reforms of the Progressive and New
  Deal periods. Today, we are in a third revolutionary situation. How will it be
  resolved—by a civil war, by reforms, or by some combination of the two?
  </blockquote>

<u id="merit">Merit</u><br>

  In this section and the next, we draw the distinction between merit and
  meritocracy.
  <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/contributors/anthony-quinton/">Anthony Quinton</a>
  defended merit-based inequality in a 1976
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41207363">article</a>
  entitled ELITISM: A BRITISH VIEW:
  <blockquote>
  I am an elitist to the extent that I believe excellence should be recognized,
  fostered, and rewarded . . . It is one thing to eliminate the inequalities that
  are, because excessive or unjustified, either unproductive or counterprodutive.
  It is another to eliminate the inequalities on which vitality and progress
  depend.
  </blockquote>
  Quinton, in advocating for inequality of this justified, merit-based kind,
  mentions a caveat, which that he is opposed to a closed caste of meritocrats,
  and, in his understanding, the class of elites are decidedly not closed but is
  open to those with ability, ambition, and energy. I will return to this point
  later, as I disagree with his claim that the marketplace provides equal
  opportunity and that entry into the elites is open to all with ability, but the
  point stands: merit, greater ability, and industry should be encouraged and
  rewarded properly.

  We start by evaluating the circumstance which dilutes individual performance and
  accountability. Bibb Latané, Kipling Williams, and Stephen Harkins reported in
  a 1979
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.37.6.822">paper</a>
  that in group tasks in which individual efforts are unidentifiable, individual
  performance decreases in a group, as a result of social loafing. The more
  people in the group, the lower the individual contribution: "[S]ocial impact
  theory suggests that the amount of effort expended on group tasks should
  decrease as an inverse power function of the number of people in the group."

  As a caveat, it is worth clarifying that
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AYZm8asAAAAJ&hl=en">P. Christopher Earley</a>
  has
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2393567">observed</a>
  that cultural factors affect the impact of social loafing: individualist
  cultures are more susceptible to social loafing than collectivist cultures.
  Earley writes:
  <blockquote>
  [A]n individualist's performance in a group setting was less than that of an
  individualist working alone. Further, this social loafing effect decreased with
  enhanced accountability for performance. Collectivists, however, did not
  demonstrate any social loafing effect and, in fact, appeared to perform better
  in a group than working alone.
  </blockquote>
  Earley, in a later
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/256525">paper</a>,
  finds further support that individualists work better on their own as opposed to
  in a group, and that collectivists work better in a group, specifically in an
  ingroup (which Earley defined as "an aggregate of people sharing similar trait
  and background characteristics") as opposed to an outgroup or alone. Earley
  attributes the effects of these advantaged performance settings for
  individualists and collectivists to an enhanced perceived self-efficacy in that
  setting, whether working individually or in an ingroup. America, for all its
  diverse groups, has a predominantly individualist culture, and it is in this
  context that I predicate my views.

  Social loafing: more recently,
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N63d3yQAAAAJ&hl=en">Jennifer Mueller</a>
  in a 2012
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2011.08.004">found</a>
  that two previously known factors of an individual's productivity loss when
  working in a team, coordination loss and motivation loss, are not sufficient to
  account for all the losses incurred when working with others—as if it is not
  enough that teamwork is beginning to sound like a train of loss, a colossal
  loss, a land of loss, a continual loss, what else could be missing but another
  loss in the already lossy team-scape?—Mueller further appends such an element
  as relational loss, as an individual perceives lower available support as teams
  grow larger. Mueller announces the new loss:
  <blockquote>
  Based on current theory and research, one might infer that in larger teams the
  best individual performers should simply minimize the amount of time spent
  coordinating and increase time spent working on individual tasks to avoid
  coordination and motivation losses . . . However, the current paper will
  suggest that even if a person were to follow these recommendations he still
  might perform worse in large group contexts. This can be attributed to
  individuals in larger teams also experiencing relational loss which has
  important consequences for individual performance.
  </blockquote>

  It goes without saying that multiple people working together can accomplish
  tasks at a scale, complexity, and availability that no individual, no matter
  how diligent and talented, is capable of attaining. But how should teams and
  companies reconcile superior individual performance with languish-prone group
  work? A 1993
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.113.1.67">paper</a>
  from
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C0Q2Qd0AAAAJ&hl=en">James Shepperd</a>,
  collating research on productivity loss in social scenarios, suggests several
  solutions to motivate performance; aside from one which involves internal
  incentive when members identify with the group and take pride in being part of
  a cohesive collective, all the proposed solutions essentially reduce group work
  into the individual's, recreating the individual context within the group
  environment: to reward individual work, to partition the group task, to hold
  individuals accountable, to privatize the social aspect into single portions,
  or to punish loafing. We can consider a real-world scenario in the case of the
  hedge fund, Bridgewater, thanks to the founder's openness with sharing his
  approach. Ray Dalio describes his company's principles of idea meritocracy and
  radical transparency in a TED
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbsVbFAczg">talk</a>
  in which he emphasizes that individuals' performances are rated and exposed to
  everyone else, granting a view into both the rater and the ratee, as each can
  be compared to others', and individuals are rewarded for higher
  credibility: "This process allows us to make decisions not based on democracy,
  not based on autocracy, but based on algorithms that take people's
  believability into consideration." In more detail, Ray Dalio writes in his 2017
  book, PRINCIPLES:
  <blockquote>
  At Bridgewater, new employees are often taken aback by how frank and direct such
  conversations can be, but it's not personal or hierarchical—no one is exempt
  from this kind of criticism. While this process is generally difficult for both
  managers and their subordinates, in the long run it has made people happier and
  Bridgewater more successful. Remember that most people are happiest when they
  are improving and doing the things that suit them naturally and help them
  advance . . . Typically it takes from six to twelve months to get to know a new
  employee in a by-and-large sort of way, and about eighteen months for them to
  internalize and adapt to the culture . . . Sometimes you need to stand by and
  let someone make a mistake (provided it's not too serious) so that they can
  learn . . . The greatest gift you can give someone is the power to be
  successful. Giving people the opportunity to struggle rather than giving them
  the things they are struggling for will make them stronger. Compliments are
  easy to give but don't help people stretch. Pointing out someone's mistakes and
  weaknesses (so they learn what they need to deal with) is harder and less
  appreciated, but much more valuable in the long run . . . Keeping people in
  jobs they are not suited for is terrible for them because it allows them to
  live in a false reality while holding back their personal evolution, and it is
  terrible for the community because it compromises the meritocracy and everyone
  pays the price . . . It is very difficult to fire people you care about.
  Cutting someone that you have a meaningful relationship with but who isn't an A
  player in their job is difficult because ending good relationships is hard, but
  it is necessary for the long-term excellence of the company . . . [W]e know
  that we cannot compromise on the fundamentals of our culture, so if a person
  cannot operate within our requirements of excellence through radical truth and
  transparency in an acceptable time frame, he or she must leave.
  </blockquote>

  Despite the array of possible losses in communal work, there is no doubt that
  working in teams is effective, and that collaborative work has grown to eclipse
  solo endeavors.

  who find that larger teams tend to develop established ideas, while small teams
  (three or fewer members) produce more disruptive, innovative work. The authors
  acknowledge that both team types are crucial to research progress, but team
  size correlates with the types of problems that the team pursues:
  <blockquote>
  [S]olo authors are just as likely to produce high-impact papers (in the top 5%
  of citations) as teams with five members, but solo-authored papers are 72% more
  likely to be highly disruptive (in the top 5% of disruptive papers). By
  contrast, ten-person teams are 50% more likely to score a high-impact paper,
  yet these contributions are much more likely to develop existing ideas already
  prominent in the system, which is reflected in the very low likelihood they are
  among the most disruptive . . . We find that solo authors and small teams much
  more often build on older, less popular ideas . . . Larger teams more often
  target recent, high-impact work as their primary source of inspiration, and
  this tendency increases monotonically with team size. It follows that large
  teams receive more of their citations rapidly, as their work is immediately
  relevant to more contemporaries whose ideas they develop and audiences primed
  to appreciate them. Conversely, smaller teams experience a much longer citation
  delay . . . [E]ven though small teams receive less recognition overall owing to
  the rapid decay of collective attention . . ., their successful research
  produces a ripple effect, which becomes an influential source of later
  large-team success.
  </blockquote>
  Two of the paper's authors
  <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-when-small-teams-are-better-than-big-ones">emphasize</a>
  the role of team size in the Harvard Business Review:
  <blockquote>
  Our results appeared remarkably robust against many tests and alternate
  explanations. For example, one could argue that certain types of people are
  more likely to work for smaller or larger teams, thus changing the outcomes
  associated with each. But when we compared the work of the <i>same
  individual</i> on a small team versus a large team, we found systematic
  differences in line with our results. We also found that team differences are
  not due to the different types of topics that large and small teams tend to
  study. This suggests it's about team size rather than the efficient sorting of
  people and problems.
  </blockquote>
  The authors write that large teams are risk-averse and prefer to work on more
  conservative problems, while smaller teams favor untested and novel ideas with
  both greater potential success and failure. But here I stress that it is with
  the possibility of greater reward that incentivizes taking on more risk; if
  such reward structures were not in place, the norm will be the relative lack of
  innovation.

  Without incentives for growth and rewards, why should an entrepreneur risk
  taking out a loan to brave a business venture if she or they receive the same
  returns as the next person who has taken no extra effort, undergone no further
  training, jeopardized no stakes greater than remaining in the security of
  regular employment? Why would a venture capitalist bet on a fledgling startup
  rather than an established, stable company if not for the promise of greater
  returns? Why would someone labor through long nights and thankless endeavors to
  manifest an invention if not to obtain benefits from the invention which are
  not freely given to those who made no contribution? If not for the benefits,
  why would anyone aspire to invent, to excel, to succeed, to do better? If
  everyone, regardless of performance, receives the same salary, why would an
  employee risk speaking out, ideate above and beyond, work overtime, remain in
  the office to work on an exciting concept long after the rest of the office has
  emptied out? I am not speaking about the casual courtesies among acquaintances
  or the convivial exchanges between friends—these are the pleasantries of life,
  and people can indulge in them as much as they desire, but these relations
  constitute only one aspect of the condition and necessity of human life—they
  incur no cost and evoke no pain, both of which the demands of work and labor
  often entail. For all the dialogue floated in public about equality, little
  recognition is given to the fruits of work as the bedrock of society's
  operations, and a reminder is in order: without adequate production, there
  won't be enough material sustenance to go around; without innovators and
  entrepreneurs, few novelties will be conceived, much less made accessible to
  the public through the market. Elon Musk, who emphasizes hard work and long
  hours, described his perspective on building a new company even in spite of
  massive risk:
  <blockquote>
  Something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree. If you just accept
  the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. So, starting SpaceX, I thought
  the odds of success were less than 10%, and I just accepted that actually,
  probably I would just lose everything, but that maybe would make some progress.
  If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died, maybe some other
  company could pick up the baton and keep it moving forward, so that would still
  do some good. Same with Tesla, I thought the odds of a car company succeeding
  were extremely low.
  </blockquote>
  Take another example in the case of the Polish film director, Krzysztof
  Kieślowski, even more fatalist but nevertheless still undeterred, who said:
  <blockquote>
  I haven't got a great talent for films. Orson Welles, for example, managed to
  achieve this at the age of twenty-four or twenty-six when he made CITIZEN KANE,
  and, with his first film, climbed to the top, to the highest possible peak in
  cinema . . . But I'll need to take all my life to get there and I never will. I
  know that perfectly well. I just keep on going. And if somebody doesn't want to
  or can't understand that this is a lasting process then obviously he or she
  will keep saying that everything I do is different, better or worse, from what
  I've done before. But for me it isn't better or worse. It's all the same only a
  step further, and, according to my own private scale of values, these are small
  steps which are taking me nearer to a goal which I'll never reach anyway. I
  haven't got enough talent.
  </blockquote>

  Differential performance, as a result of innovation or more industrious work, is
  essential to growth, to business, to research, to productivity. True equality
  is impossible; while equal pay for equal work is feasible and we may aspire
  towards equal opportunity for all, it is delusional to expect that everyone's
  performance be equal; it is absurd and destructive to mandate equal outcomes to
  maintain nominal equality.
  <a href="https://www.hoover.org/profiles/alex-inkeles">Alex Inkeles</a>
  writes in a 1950
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2087305">paper</a>
  that despite the Soviet Union's attempt at equality:
  <blockquote>
  It would appear that the Communist regime has not been highly successful in
  preventing the stratification of society into social-class groups, and is
  certainly a long way from having eliminated them . . . Soviet experience
  indicates that the very fact of modern large-scale production—involving extreme
  division of labor, precise differentiation of function, emphasis on technical
  competence, and elaborate hierarchies of authority and responsiblity—provides a
  natural basis for the development of distinct social groups. Such differences
  in the relations of individuals to the productive process tend to yield
  inequalities in economic reward because of the differential position of certain
  persons in the labor market.
  </blockquote>

  I was still rather young in 1971 when
  <a href="https://contemporarythinkers.org/irving-kristol/">Irving Kristol</a>
  published in The Atlantic an
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/08/welfare-the-best-of-intentions-the-worst-of-results/662341/">article</a>
  commenting on state welfare, his view summarized in the title, WELFARE: THE BEST
  OF INTENTIONS, THE WORST OF RESULTS. Kristol describes how welfare benefits
  compete with the market's wages for labor, and when the benefits rise, more and
  more people will favor welfare over productive work, citing Tocqueville's view
  on pauperism. Tocqueville himself writes against welfare in MEMOIR ON
  PAUPERISM:
  <blockquote>
  Man, like all socially organised beings, has a natural passion for idleness.
  There are, however, two incentives to work: the need to live and the desire to
  improve the conditions of life. Experience has proven that the majority of men
  can be sufficiently motivated to work only by the first of these incentives.
  The second is only effective with a small minority. Well, a charitable
  institution indiscriminately open to all those in need, or a law which gives
  all the poor a right to public aid, whatever the origin of their poverty,
  weakens or destroys the first stimulant and leaves only the second intact . . .
  [T]he peasant . . ., I maintain, has no interest in working, or, if he works,
  has no interest in saving. He therefore remains idle or thoughtlessly squanders
  the fruits of his labours . . . [T]he most generous, the most active, the most
  industrious part of the nation, which devotes its resources to furnishing the
  means of existence for those who do nothing or who make bad use of their
  labour . . . What is to prevent society from inquiring into the causes of the
  need before giving assistance? Why could work not be imposed as a condition on
  the able-bodied indigent who asks for public pity? . . . Any measure which
  establishes legal charity on a permanent basis and gives it an administrative
  form thereby creates an idle and lazy class, living at the expense of the
  industrial and working class.
  </blockquote>
  I am not completely against welfare or some form of government influence on the
  market, for the reason we shall see in the next section, and while Tocqueville
  writes harshly of what he calls "legal charity", there is some truth to his
  claim that a system which provides free sustenance will demotivate those
  dependent on it from remediating their own situations. However, in the general
  case, it should be that merit should be prioritized.

<u id="meritocracy">Meritocracy</u><br>

  It is hard to fault merit, to deny that those who work harder, longer, are more
  responsible for their actions, take initiative and risk, push for innovation,
  that those with greater ability and willingness to apply themselves should
  receive correspondingly more substantial rewards for their greater effort and
  productivity. I agree with this point. Ben Carson recently
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4pf3-sqCUg">spoke</a>
  on Fox News about the importance of merit and equality of opportunity, which I
  find sensible and proper. He additionally said "this equity stuff is garbage,
  quite frankly." If what he meant by equity is equality of outcome, then I also
  stand in agreement. However, if by equity he is referring to policies or slight
  preferences given to disadvantaged groups so that they may attain some
  semblance of equality of opportunity, I disagree. The issue is whether equality
  of opportunity currently exists. But this raises a question: if merit and
  differential outcomes and rewards are desired, are these forces not sufficient
  and satisfactory? What are the limits of merit? It turns out that, in order to
  understand the complete picture, it is not enough to reason on the simple basis
  of (1) opportunity is equally available to everyone, and (2) in a system that
  rewards merit, those with greater ability and commitment earn their deserved
  positions of success. Our discussion so far has considered only the virtues of
  merit, of the second point, but not the first, which is not true because of
  generational consequences, of how privilege, benefits, and advantages are
  passed on from meritorious parents to their children who are groomed into
  replicating their parents' positions, creating asymmetric access to
  opportunity. I have up to this point resisted using the term meritocracy to
  describe my support of merit, for while merit itself is commendable, a system
  based on merit also encompasses the human tendencies and generational
  ramifications of meritocrats bequeathing privilege to their offspring.

  There is no difficulty in conceiving of the trappings of meritocracy. In the
  article mentioned earlier advocating merit, Quinton himself considers them:
  <blockquote>
  Sterner egalitarians argue that once you allow a minority, whether excellent or
  not, to acquire power and status, its members will inevitably use their
  position to secure an economic advantage for themselves. And once that happens,
  you have the makings of a closed caste . . . What is more important in the long
  run is that the members of an elite that is notably better off than the mass of
  the population will try to confer on their children the advantages they
  themselves have enjoyed.
  </blockquote>
  Quinton offsets this potential by reasoning that when the children of the
  elites, inheriting wealth and privilege, lack the ability of their parents,
  they will fall from their elite status; the inherited elite will decay and lose
  their position to the ambitious and able from the more moderate classes:
  <blockquote>
  Now, if wealth is inherited by those who have neither inherited the ability of
  those who acquired it nor, for some reason or other, derived any advantage from
  the circumstances of their upbringing, elite positions will be secured by those
  who do not have the qualities, whatever they may be, by which those positions
  were obtained in the first place. The elite, in other words, will decay.
  </blockquote>
  This reasoning is sensible but this does not seem to be what happens; elite
  parents use every means to pass on their privileges, the elites strive to hold
  on to their status, even to competitive extremes of unenjoyable meritocratic
  labor that consume much of their lives, throughout their school years and
  continuing into their professional careers.

  Class differences begin early.
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wzzVOIoAAAAJ&hl=en">Annette Lareau</a>
  studied first-graders and their parents in a 1987
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2112583">paper</a>
  in which she describes differences, between one working-class and one
  upper-middle-class school, in parental involvement in their children's
  schooling. Middle-class parents had higher expectations, were more proactive
  with the school, and provided further educational opportunities outside of
  school. Lareau attributes these differences to differential parental resources,
  financial, cultural, educational. The study focused on white communities, but
  presumably the observations apply elsewhere, to both predominantly non-white
  and racially mixed student bodies. Lareau proceeds in 2002 to
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/3088916">describe</a>
  the middle-class childrearing approach as concerted cultivation, in which
  parents play a significant role in their children's upbringing, scheduling
  activities, fostering language use, and training the children to reason,
  grooming their opinions and sense of self. Working-class and poor parents used,
  in Lareau's terminology, the strategy of natural growth, in which children are
  given more freedom in their leisure time but whose views and opinions were not
  prompted when interacting with parents. Lareau further
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24756698">writes</a>,
  in 2015, on how middle-class, as opposed to poor and working-class, parents use
  their cultural knowledge to help their children prepare for and navigate
  institutions and schools, leveraging their familiarity to obtain help and
  advantage, and this knowledge is passed on to their children.

  Of the upper middle class:
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZWZ98swAAAAJ&hl=en">Richard Reeves</a>,
  writes in his 2017 book, DREAM HOARDERS:
  <blockquote>
  Upper middle-class children have a very different upbringing than ordinary kids.
  In particular, they develop the skills, attributes, and credentials valued in
  the labor market. By the time Americans are old enough to drink, their place in
  the class system is clear. Upper middle-class parents obviously have more money
  to spend on their children and many ways to spend it. But this is also a social
  fracture. A class is not only defined in dollars, but by education, attitude,
  and zip code; not only by its economic standard of living, but by its way of
  life . . . The typical child born and raised in the American upper middle class
  is raised in a stable home by well-educated, married parents, lives in a great
  neighborhood, and attends the area's best schools. They develop a wide range of
  skills and gain and impressive array of credentials. Upper middle-class
  children lucked out right from the start.
  </blockquote>
  Reeves remarks how class advantage shores up privilege through, among other
  things, exclusionary zoning, preferential treatment in college admissions, and
  unpaid internships:
  <blockquote>
  [T]he main reason the children of the upper middle class end up as winners,
  especially in the labor market, is by being strong competitors . . . But we
  cannot ignore another contributor to class persistence: opportunity hoarding.
  This occurs when the upper middle class does not win by being better but by
  rigging the competition in our favor.
  </blockquote>
  And specifically the wealthiest: last year,
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PhDDPiUAAAAJ&hl=en">Raj Chetty</a>
  released a working
  <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/collegeadmissions/">paper</a>
  on how the top 1% receives admissions advantages to Ivy-Plus colleges through
  legacy preferences, non-academic factors like extracurricular activities and
  personality traits, and athletic recruitment. And earlier, in 2017, Chetty
  published a
  <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/losteinsteins/">paper</a>
  on how the children who grow up to be inventors are more likely to come from
  high-income households, even among children who had similar test scores, a
  barometer for equal ability. Chetty's study further reveals that environmental
  effects play an important role in children's eventual likelihood to innovate,
  which is enhanced by early exposure to innovative environments through their
  parents or neighborhoods. Chetty elaborates:
  <blockquote>
  [T]he data point to mechanisms such as transmission of specific human capital,
  access to networks that help children pursue a certain subfield, acquisition of
  information about certain careers, or role model effects.
  </blockquote>

  This meritocratic concentration of privilege emerged in the Soviet Union as
  well, and was even sustained by the state, as Victor Zaslavsky
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/656861">wrote</a>
  in 1980:
  <blockquote>
  That the class of specialists (intelligentsia) attempt to perpetuate itself is a
  well-known truism from the middle 1960s, and one could even find in the Soviet
  press the observation that "for the most part, the stratum of the
  intelligentsia reproduces itself." In recent years these testimonies are even
  more frequent because "the principal context of most serious Soviet discussions
  of social inequality has been the problem of access to higher education." . . .
  [T]he system of selection [into higher education] based on competitive entrance
  examinations has become an instrument for the transmission of specialist
  positions from one generation to the next . . . In contrast to all other
  classes, the majority of specialists have the right to reside in closed cities
  [the major urban areas of the Soviet Union where residence requires special
  permission by birth, inheritance, or official authorization, enforced with the
  internal passport system] where, coincidentally, all major universities are
  located as well. <i>The specialists are geographically, professionally, and
  structurally connected with the system of higher education.</i> This factor
  underlies, and to a significant extent determines, the operation of related
  factors such as access to better schooling, housing, and especially to personal
  ties and contacts with relevant networks.
  </blockquote>

  Meritocracy encourages entrenched privilege over generations; those who become
  professors tend to be the children of professors who from early on have been
  exposed to the resources and the orientation towards academics, who have been
  groomed to value education, having learned how to seek the right opportunities,
  the preparatory credentials, the onset of institutionalized merit, largely
  unknown to those without such exposure. This inherited privilege is
  particularly pernicious to the reputation of the upper middle class because,
  unlike very exclusive factions in the top 0.5%, the upper middle class has the
  image of open access to those who work sufficiently hard. This is true for
  those who work hard in the proper direction early enough, but there appears to
  be an element of pseudo-aristocracy encroaching onto the merit ladder in the
  form of foot stools and climbing lessons for certain children whose parents who
  both know and can afford these stools and lessons. This image of the upper
  middle class as having doors to merit, as predicated on equal opportunity, is
  false, misleading, and damaging to everyone: those locked out and those within
  who, within their privileged quarters, must endeavor and compete among
  themselves.
  <a href="https://law.yale.edu/daniel-markovits">Daniel Markovits</a>
  explains in MERITOCRACY TRAP how inequality grows as elite meritocrats invest in
  their children, sending them to exclusive schools early on, and when the
  children earn their privileged positions, they repeat the process with their
  own children, leading to accumulating inequality. He writes:
  <blockquote>
  Meritocratic inequality grows—and meritocracy builds and then reinforces its
  trap—through a series of feedback loops. The most important connects
  meritocratic inequality's two basic building blocks: the exceptional training
  that rich children receive in school and the extravagant incomes that elite
  skills sustain at work.
  </blockquote>
  For a brief overview, Markovits
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn1_jhqqNQ0">describes</a>
  the issues with meritocracy at the Oxford Union. As Markovits notes, it is
  ferocious competition to function within the lifestyle of meritocrats, through
  all the stages from childhood to adulthood. Let us connect the image of this
  highly competitive endeavor which Markovits calls "extreme meritocratic
  competition" with Turchin's perspective on elite overproduction and excess
  degrees: we see the cascade from college onwards, either from graduate school
  to tenured professorship or from law school to corporate legal careers, in
  which elite aspirants in the form of degree holders compete for finite slots,
  generating surplus elites who, excluded from the elite occupations they were
  trained to acquire, are positioned to assume populist leadership roles at the
  helm of immiserated masses.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  They [urban meritocrats] are extremely stressed out about their kids' academic
  fortunes starting in ninth grade, or even earlier. They expect their students
  to end up at a top university. Educational consultants are hired for thousands
  of dollars, prep for standardized tests starts in tenth grade, and all the
  while activities—lacrosse, volunteering, chess club, debate team—are
  scrupulously chosen . . . Are they too obsessed? Perhaps. But what they really
  are is conscious of how difficult it is to get into a top university and the
  steps that are necessary to make it happen.

  The vocal liberal crusade for justice, it seems, consists in part of privileged
  folks who, aware that their privilege is precarious, wish to secure more
  privilege, and they operate under the guise of identifying with those who are
  genuinely struggling. As Markovits observes of potential solutions to the harms
  of meritocracy:
  <blockquote>
  Progressives cannot answer because they remain under meritocracy's thumb. They
  are captives who embrace their captor, through a sort of ideological Stockholm
  syndrome. As a result, progressives exacerbate problems that they do not even

  discussing Turchin's book, describes "the children of the current [financial
  top] 10%" with a sobering comment:
  <blockquote>
  Every time I come across them, [they] appear to be radical at a level which is
  genuinely shocking to people of my age. Whether they're approaching it from the
  left or from the right, they're willing to contemplate political possibilities
  which would be simply unthinkable for a late Gen-Xer such as I am. I think
  we're in, as Peter says, for some pretty rough times, and I think the contours
  of those rough times may be considerably broader and more chaotic than perhaps
  any of us would like.
  </blockquote>
  If these radical youths are converging on political ends which are unthinkable
  to a Gen-Xer, imagine how much more unthinkable they are to someone even older
  like the writer! But the penchant for privileged liberals to engage in
  self-flagellation in the form of books, talks, and on college campuses is in
  itself harmless and admirable, but unless some remedial courses of action are
  adopted, ideals remain caged in words, hopes, longings, and, in pretty
  conference rooms, staring blankly. The action, it needs to be emphasized, must
  be of the right sort, not merely to instigate unrest or to further heighten
  domestic tensions. I describe my views on this matter later in this post, but
  at a glance, I concur with the liberal stance that the trouble stems from the
  economic inequality caused by the money at the very top, and I believe the
  problem does not stem from the friction between liberals and populist
  conservatives, which is only the surface discontent. In mentioning the prospect
  of heightening tensions in the near future, I don't wish to sound alarming, and
  there exists some tempering perspectives such as Currid-Halkett's, but we
  should keep in mind the very real possibility of even greater unrest in the
  coming years, as Turchin suggests. There's a dictator on both sides of the
  pond, and both rely heavily on surveillance and mass censorship. I don't think
  that's a desirable outcome for anyone. In his book, Turchin mentions
  geopolitical tension as one factor for state dissolution, but another is
  implosion, when domestic tensions themselves result in state collapse.

  I was walking in the woods a year or two ago with someone who was telling me

  saying that mycelia are sentient and can live for thousands of years. He told
  me that in the grand scheme of things, we humans aren't the top dog in the

  comment at the moment, though later the thought occurred to me: every deer,
  bear, wolf, worm, squirrel, beaver, and human too who hasn't been locked up in
  a ceremonial box, gets decomposed in the earth and eventually become part of a
  mycelium. These colossal networks underneath—how many creatures and memories,
  how many generations, how many lives, have been absorbed by their roots like
  rain drops into the soil? I suppose it knows many things, and maybe it's proper
  for organisms to return to something. Maybe that's what judges us in the end,
  not a mighty man in the sky or the silence of an apathetic universe but just a
  really big and really old fungus.

<u id="liberal-hypocrisy">Liberal Hypocrisy</u><br>

  My fellow liberals, my fellow intellectual, cultured, cosmopolitan,
  sophisticated, well-traveled, well-read, well-credentialed dignitaries, all of
  us immersed in a splendid diversity of cultures and cuisines, my fellow
  recycling fanatics, vegans, organic-chomping frequenters of farmers' markets,
  my fellow consumers of single-origin-beans blended into a fine cup of cortado,
  our muscles impressively toned from all that vinyasa and meditating too long in
  the lotus position, my comrades of state-subsidized, media-endorsed, popularly
  accepted hegemonic officialdom, let us not thrust aside for even a moment our
  moral superiority and classist appetites, because we, in spite of this
  section's title, are certainly not hypocrites! Does criticism cut deeper and
  make a more lasting impact if it comes from another liberal?

  For this must be an uncommon situation: it doesn't trouble anyone that too often
  those on this side proffer loud words but take no action. Were we tempted to
  advocate the truth, the high and unshaking truth itself pledges to reveal that
  liberals turn out to be innocent on all accounts! What, then, could be wrong
  with liberals refusing to instate their own agendas? What a measly
  inconvenience it is that Johnny Harris at The New York Times
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNDgcjVGHIw">contrasted</a>
  the Democrats' proclaimed support for higher taxes on the wealthy and more
  affordable housing with their actual legislation once they acquire state power:
  their adamance on equitable rights quietly slip away into sudden absence when
  they get the chance for some follow through! This is clearly only a minor
  nuisance, nothing disconcerting! Even though liberals rally behind equity and
  justice and inclusiveness yet enact none of these when they have power, they
  are surely not hypocrites! All is well, and nothing could be better!

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  [T]he virtues we get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of
  the arts as well. For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we
  learn by doing them . . . Since, then, the present inquiry does not aim at
  theoretical knowledge like the others (for we are inquiring not in order to
  know what virtue is, but in order to become good, since otherwise our inquiry
  would have been of no use), we must examine the nature of actions, namely how
  we ought to do them; for these determine also the nature of the states of
  character that are produced . . . But most people do not do these, but take
  refuge in theory and think that they are being philosophers and will become
  good this way, behaving somewhat like patients who listen attentively to their
  doctors, but do none of the things they are ordered to do. As the latter will
  not be made well in body by such a course of treatment, the former will not be
  made well in soul by such a course of philosophy.

  But halt! It is a strange phenomenon for some to behold that outside of
  politics, the liberal persona has attained the complete reversal of outspoken
  progressivism. Too proud to be caught in the public square, we liberals deeply
  crave subtlety, especially when it comes to distinction, class trappings,
  material comfort, and their signaling. In a 2010 paper entitled
  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/4/555/1795043">Subtle Signals of Inconspicuous Consumption</a>,
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jGzE0DAAAAAJ&hl=en">Jonah Berger</a>
  and
  <a href="">Morgan Ward</a>
  describe inconspicuous consumption in purchases and their value in signaling
  group identity:
  <blockquote>
  [W]hile the moneyed elite go after items the lower classes could never purchase
  (e.g., yachts and caviar), educated elites often select the same items that the
  working class buys but in rarefied form (e.g., free range chicken legs or
  heirloom potatoes from France). In doing so, the educated elite not only
  distinguish themselves from the moneyed elite but do so in ways that the
  moneyed elite are unlikely to copy. Given that the moneyed elite want to
  distinguish themselves from the lower classes, they are unlikely to do
  something similar, so behaving like the lower classes in certain respects is a
  good way for the educated elite to discourage the moneyed elite from poaching
  their signals . . . This pattern is similar to what we observed in the
  cross-category analyses of handbags and sunglasses. While low-end items tend
  not to display brand names or logos, middle-tier options often do, which
  distinguishes them from cheaper alternatives. High-end options, however,
  distinguish themselves from the middle tier by the absence of logos, which also
  makes them resemble low-end options. People in the know, however, are able to
  use subtle signals to distinguish such products. Similar behavior can also be
  seen more generally in situations where high-status individuals behave
  similarly to low-status individuals on certain dimensions to avoid looking like
  middle-status individuals who themselves want to avoid looking low status.
  </blockquote>
  What great fun! The monumental scale of our capitalist endeavors, even among
  liberals who champion anti-capitalism, amounts to no more than a collective
  game of tag! But we learn there's a cost! The researchers continue:
  <blockquote>
  While economists often suggest that widely recognizable markers will be
  preferred . . . we demonstrate that by selecting subtle signals, certain
  consumers will forgo widespread identification to facilitate interaction with
  others in the know. By choosing items that are more likely to be unrecognized
  or misidentified as cheaper alternatives by the general population, insiders
  incur an interaction cost. But in doing so, they also select a more reliable
  signal of their desired characteristics. Because most consumers want to be
  correctly identified by most observers, they will be unwilling to select subtle
  signals that decrease recognition.
  </blockquote>
  And with a subtlety whose delicacy exceeds even their material nuance, liberals
  have never been caught signaling their righteousness, their correct moral
  opinions never having been thrust into the open for all to see!

  Equipped with such charming virtues, by no means a beguiling facade, how can
  educated liberals not adore each other and coalesce into an elegant new class?
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/david-brooks">David Brooks</a>
  writes in his 2000 book, BOBOS IN PARADISE:
  <blockquote>
  In this era ideas and knowledge are at least as vital to economic success as
  natural resources and finance capital. The intangible world of information
  merges with the material world of money . . . So the people who thrive in this
  period are the ones who can turn ideas and emotions into products. These are
  highly educated folk who have one foot in the bohemian world of creativity and
  another foot in the bourgeois realm of ambition and worldly success. The
  members of the new information age elite are bourgeois bohemians
  [Bobos] . . . The sociologists they read in college taught that consumerism is
  a disease, and yet now they find themselves shopping for $3,000
  refrigerators . . . This is an elite that has been raised to oppose elites.
  They are affluent yet oppposed to materialism . . . [T]o be treated well in
  this world, not only do you have to show some income results; you have to
  perform a series of feints to show how little your worldly success means to
  you. You always want to dress one notch lower than those around you . . . or
  somehow perform some other socially approved act of antistatus deviance . . .
  It's kind of pretentious to build yourself a big estate with magnificently
  manicured grounds. But nobody can accuse you of getting too big for your
  britches if you devote fanatical attention to small household items, like
  selecting exactly the right pasta strainer . . . The idea behind all this
  effort is to show that you have so much brainpower to spare, you can even be
  thoughtful about your water flow . . . It is not sufficient to buy stuff that
  is old. It is necessary in addition to go down the social scale and purchase
  objects that once belonged to persons much poorer than yourself . . . The old
  elite may have copied the styles of the European aristocrats or the colonial
  masters, but the Bobos prefer the colonial victims . . . The companies that
  appeal to educated consumers not only are informing us about things but are
  providing a philosophical context for our product.
  </blockquote>
  Much philosophy, indeed! It follows directly that their customers are all
  profound philosophers! How much more enlightened and proper are our purchases
  when we adorn such important transactions with brand histories and their
  founders' stories, how we stand in unison with disenfranchised locals and
  communities when we see their traditions dressed up in campaigns that certainly
  are not marketing maneuvers! In this continual conflict between public ideals
  and private greed that demands even to consume someone's origin story, an inner
  hunger that wishes to trace every part of a purchase to its source, do liberals
  ever tire?

  The heroine of our earlier investigations, Currid-Halkett, describes her
  conception of an even newer class of elites that de-emphasizes materialism in
  her 2017 book, THE SUM OF SMALL THINGS:
  <blockquote>
  This new, dominant cultural elite can be called, quite simply, the
  <i>aspirational class</i>. While their symbolic position sometimes manifests
  itself through material goods, mostly they reveal their class position through
  cultural signifiers that convey their acquisition of knowledge and value
  system—dinner party conversation around opinion pieces, bumper stickers that
  express political views and support for Greenpeace, and showing up at farmer's
  markets. These behaviors and signifiers imply aspirational class values . . .
  Today's aspirational class prizes ideas, cultural and social awareness, and the
  acquisition of knowledge in forming ideas and making choices ranging from their
  careers to the type of sliced bread they purchase at the grocery store. In each
  of these decisions, big and small, they strive to feel informed and legitimate
  in their belief that they have made the right and reasonable decision based on
  facts . . . He carries a canvas tote that displays a political or literary
  statement as another signal of his cultural knowledge and engagement with the
  intellectual current of the moment . . . Today's cultural hegemony is dominated
  by the aspirational class who are not idly sitting around but productively
  acquiring physical and metaphysical benefits for themselves and their
  offspring. As such, their consumer behavior has shifted from material displays
  of status to more implicit and tacitly coded means of showing social and
  economic position and reproducing their position of wealth for future
  generations . . . Rather than buying silver spoons and going on long holidays,
  their investments in education, health, retirement, and parenting ensure the
  reproduction of status (and often wealth too) for their offspring in a way that
  no material good can . . . What is most concerning about today's elites is that
  behaviors that appear to be moral or value-laden choices are deeply embedded in
  socioeconomic position and many of these decisions are quotidian, not grand
  material signifiers.
  </blockquote>
  Could it be that all this liberal gesturing amounts only to class association
  and class signaling? But I hear my liberal compatriots: how could their genuine
  heartfelt sympathies be reduced to the hideous class distinctions their very
  platform abhors? Let no one equate liberal virtue signaling to that disgusting
  class posturing which pollutes the air full of gloating college students!

  venerable Currid-Halkett, with her later book on rural America, with the
  kindness of her all-encompassing inclusiveness advocating for equality,
  sympathizing as ever with her interviewees, for some reason doesn't leave shop
  from her comfortable coastal Los Angeles home and career to stake up her claim
  among the fine folks in the countryside she wishes her fellow liberals to
  regard on equal terms. Sympathy surely goes very far! As a matter of fact, she
  makes her position on meritocracy clear in how she rears her three children,
  writing in THE OVERLOOKED AMERICANS:
  <blockquote>
  My children are young, but if I am fortunate enough to be able to support them
  fully as they approach the college application process, I certainly will. Why
  wouldn't I do as much as I possibly can to help my children reach their
  potential, to get into the college of their dreams? But I am aware of how this
  process is alien to most American families. So much so that Richard Reeves
  calls the meritocratic elite "dream hoarders." Reeves argues [in his book DREAM
  HOARDERS] that the entire system is set up such that social mobility remains
  among a rarified echelon of American society (his cutoff is the top 20 percent,
  although the band could be even narrower).
  </blockquote>
  She sure will! And like every liberal professor, lawyer, doctor, investor,
  consultant, manager, and executive who publicly espouses equality with
  grandiose words a great many in the highest pitch, she and her family are
  exceptions to their own principles. What about those left out of the
  meritocracy? Ah, well, that's a problem for other people and their kids. Ellen
  Brantlinger et al. observe in their 1996
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1163277">paper</a>:
  <blockquote>
  Although in some ways the mothers in this study expressed the caring, socially
  inclusive perspective associated with women . . ., it appears that their role
  as status maintainers for the family—in this case, pushing their children and
  pushing for their children in school—put them in a contradictory and dissonant
  position. Most were attracted to socially inclusive, integrated ideals of
  education, but were intent on having advantaged circumstances for their own
  children . . . [E]ducated, middle-class mothers, perceived by others as well as
  themselves as liberals who believe in integrated and inclusive education, often
  support segregated and stratified school structures that mainly benefit
  students of the middle class . . . The study reveals that ideology operates to
  create social class distinctive positions and identifications and allows
  privileged educational and societal status to be justified.
  </blockquote>
  My esteemed reader, blessed be your optimism! La Rochefoucauld describes
  kindness:
  <blockquote>
  The good faith that appears in most men [or women, for we are inclusive!] is
  merely an invention of self-love aimed at winning trust; it is a means of
  elevating ourselves and to make ourselves trustees for things that are more
  important.

  In token liberal pride, Currid-Halkett helps herself and her children onto the
  bandwagon riding towards greener pastures while she preaches back to the
  onlooking crowd that she sympathizes with them and, seriously enough, rebukes
  the other passengers for contributing to inequality. My problem with
  Currid-Halkett is not that she pursues self-interest, for everyone does, and
  she is no different, but that she, though well-meaning in researching rural
  America, tells herself and her fellow urban liberals to feel differently
  towards the heartland while she at the same time takes no further action than
  words, empathy, and good feelings, and in doing so benefiting from her position
  in the posh liberal hegemony as she leaves the problem just as plump and intact
  as before.

  I speak of the importance of action. I wish to briefly contrast Currid-Halkett
  with Amy Coney Barrett. Action: Barrett adopted two children from Haiti;
  raising kids takes time, energy, money, and commitment that entail more than
  words, condolences, and sympathy. Currid-Halkett, of course, availed herself to
  what she thought was progress: calling for urban meritocrats to shift their
  views on meritocracy and rural Americans: nice, fine words. I don't mean to
  diminish Currid-Halkett's efforts and ideals, but I actually find Barrett's
  approach more humble, graceful, proper: rather than relying solely on research,
  talking, and publicity, Barrett and her husband took it upon themselves to
  bring two kids into their family and raise them.

  of The Brooklyn Rail, in which

  summarizes his interpretation of the art at the 60th Venice Biennale:
  <blockquote>
  Taken as a whole, this large panoply of works reminds us once again that having
  a free mind means turning away from dogma, political certainties, theoretical
  comforts, and spoon-fed ideologies or social engineering; that we must find
  ways to stay true to the issues of our vulnerability, our sense of mystery, and
  the perplexities of reality, for they are our best chances of remaining fully
  human.
  </blockquote>
  Are we to understand that if we bare our hearts, weep out all our tears, hug
  everyone we see, commune with the mysteries of the universe, remain in tune
  with people's feelings, that we can solve our present political dilemmas, that
  by extending our precious human sympathies, we can fix the very real
  disparities in material wealth? Or are these just words intended to solicit
  some back-patting from a community rather obsessed with feeling better about
  itself? Can we conjure a genie and make three wishes? To be clear, I'm sure Bui
  has the best of intentions, but words reek of duplicity and run the risk of
  hypocrisy; actions have the convenient benefit that more accurately reveal
  people as they are, but action, truth, and real progress, unfortunately, quite
  often don't coddle anyone's feelings.

  Consider the tide of artifice in the wake of liberal sympathies. After the
  Supreme Court ended affirmative action in college admissions last year,
  <a href="https://www.bates.edu/faculty-expertise/profile/tyler-a-harper/">Tyler Austin Harper</a>
  published an opinion
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/college-admissions-affirmative-action.html">piece</a>
  in The New York Times, writing that even in the prior few years when he was
  still a graduate student on a summer job:
  <blockquote>
  Seemingly everyone I interacted with as a [college admissions] tutor — white or
  brown, rich or poor, student or parent — believed that getting into an elite
  college required what I came to call racial gamification. For these students,
  the college admissions process had been reduced to performance art, in which
  they were tasked with either minimizing or maximizing their identity in
  exchange for the reward of a proverbial thick envelope from their dream
  school.
  </blockquote>
  Specifically, Harper writes:
  <blockquote>
  The Chinese and Korean kids wanted to know how to make their application
  materials seem less Chinese or Korean. The rich white kids wanted to know ways
  to seem less rich and less white. The Black kids wanted to make sure they came
  across as Black enough. Ditto for the Latino and Middle Eastern kids.
  </blockquote>
  Harper elaborates on his views:
  <blockquote>
  Let me be clear that I am not an opponent of affirmative action. I don't think I
  would have gotten into Haverford College as an undergraduate if it had not been
  for affirmative action, and the same is probably true of my Ph.D. program at
  New York University and the professorship I now hold at Bates College. I
  believe that affirmative action works, that it is necessary to redress the
  historical evils of chattel slavery and its myriad afterlives and, above all,
  that it is a crucial counterbalance against the prevailing system of de facto
  white affirmative action that rewards many academically mediocre (and wealthier)
  students for having legacy parents or for being good at rowing a boat. Yet I
  also believe that affirmative action — though necessary — has inadvertently
  helped create a warped and race-obsessed American university culture. Before
  students ever set foot on a rolling green, they are encouraged to see racial
  identity as the most salient aspect of their personhood, inextricable from
  their value and merit.
  </blockquote>
  I must say that I am on the same boat as Harper when advises, "Doing nothing is
  better than doing something if the something in question is P.R. skulduggery"
  in the form of "more antiracist action plans, more vaporous decolonization,
  more mandated training, more huckster consultants, more vacuous reports, more
  administrators whose jobs no one can explain" and "the D.E.I.-industrial
  complex, which prioritizes the kind of cheap fixes, awareness raising and
  one-off speaker events that have been shown to bear little fruit."
  <a href="https://www.bu.edu/wheelock/profile/anthony-abraham-jack/">Anthony Abraham Jack</a>,

  2019
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/10/magazine/college-inequality.html">article</a>
  in The New York Times Magazine:
  <blockquote>
  Colleges have made racial and class diversity into virtues with which they
  welcome students during orientation and entice alumni to make donations. But
  students of color and those from lower-income backgrounds often bear the brunt
  of the tension that exists between proclamation and practice of this social
  experiment. Schools cannot simply showcase smiling black and brown faces in
  their glossy brochures and students wearing shirts blaring "First Gen and
  Proud" in curated videos and then abdicate responsibility for the problems from
  home that a more diverse class may bring with them to campus.

  in The Atlantic about the current conservative push for public schools to censor
  many political issues, among them race and gender. Hixenbaugh observes how this
  censorship is similar to the Reagan-era's religion-derived censorship and
  backlash against a rising secular humanism. This censorship is perhaps more
  egregious on the left, as liberals do not just pander to political correctness;
  they deceive by virtue signaling. Moving forward, are social norms to remain
  bound by false modesty and restraint, and is society to prescribe costumes for
  everyone in this public theatre? I ask: why is everyone so afraid of the
  truth?

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  Our civilization cannot afford to let the censor-moron loose. The censor-moron
  does not really hate anything but the living and growing human consciousness.
  It is our developing and extending consciousness that he threatens—and our
  consciousness in its newest, most sensitive activity, its vital growth. To
  arrest or circumscribe the vital consciousness is to produce morons, and

  their own authority—become fully aware of their dominance only as it started to
  ebb.

<u id="inequality">Inequality: Rousseau</u><br>

  Inequality is currently a mounting issue in the country. It should come as no
  surprise that it has also been a recurring element in past societies. Rousseau
  informs this discussion on inequality, as he described society in its thrall,
  explained its causes and consequences, and suggested a solution. Let us start
  with his first major work, where he established his fundamental principle upon
  which his subsequent writings would further develop—Rousseau contended that man
  in nature is good but has been corrupted by society. In DISCOURSE ON THE
  SCIENCES AND ARTS, his First Discourse, he made the daring inversion that,
  contrary to Enlightenment values, in stark opposition to the common assumption
  that innovation drives mankind forward, it is civilized man who is degraded and
  unscrupulous, and that it is primitive man who is noble and principled.
  Rousseau argued that intellectual progress, cultural sophistication, the
  advancement of knowledge, the accumulation of luxuries, mark a step towards
  decline, duplicity, conformity, and obligatory surface charm over actual
  virtue:
  <blockquote>
  While government and law provide for the security and well-being of people in
  their collective life, the sciences, letters, and arts—less despotic though
  perhaps more powerful—wrap garlands of flowers around the chains that weight
  people down. They stifle the sense of freedom that people once had and for
  which they sensed that they were born, making them love their own servitude,
  and turning them into what is called a civilized people. Need erected thrones;
  the sciences and arts consolidated them. Let the Powers that rule the earth
  cherish all talents and protect those who practice them! Civilized peoples,
  cultivate your talents! Happy slaves, you are indebted to them for the
  delicate, exquisite tastes you are so proud of, that sweetness of disposition
  and urbanity of manners that make social relations so easy and pleasant—in
  short, the appearance of virtues without the possession of a single one . . .
  Certain excesses will be condemned, certain vices abhorred, but others will be
  honored in the name of virtue, and people will be obliged either to have them
  or to pretend to have them.
  </blockquote>
  We now return to a text we previously mentioned, Rousseau's Second Discourse, in
  which he traces, through his hypothetical historical development of
  civilization, the dawn of inequality. Men, originating as solitary individuals
  in nature, came together first as families, then social groups, then societies.
  I quoted earlier how Rousseau attributed to natural inequalities their
  consequences on performance, using the examples of the "man that had most
  strength performed most labor; the most dexterous turned his labor to best
  account; the most ingenious found out methods of lessening his labor". Rousseau
  observes the ensuing state of affairs and denounces the many insidious problems
  with inequality, writing pointedly against desire, comparison, deception, and
  appearances:
  <blockquote>
  Behold all our natural qualities put in motion; the rank and lot of every man
  established, not only as to the amount of property and power of serving or
  hurting others, but likewise as to genius, beauty, strength, or skill, merits
  or talents; and as these were the only qualities which could command respect,
  it was found necessary to have or at least to affect them. It became to the
  interest of men to appear what they were really not. To be and to seem became
  two very different things, and from this distinction sprang haughty pomp and
  deceitful knavery, and all the vices which form their train. On the other hand,
  man, heretofore free and independent, was now, in consequence of a multitude of
  new needs, brought into subjection, as it were, to all nature, and especially
  to his fellows, whose slave in some sense he became . . . He must therefore
  have been continually at work to interest them in his happiness . . .: this
  rendered him sly and artful in his dealings with some, imperious and cruel in
  his dealings with others . . . In fine, an insatiable ambition, the rage of
  raising their relative fortunes, not so much through real necessity as to
  overtop others, inspires all men with a wicked inclination to injure each
  other . . . to carry its point with the greater security it often puts on the
  mask of benevolence . . . [C]itizens only allow themselves to be oppressed in
  proportion as hurried on by a blind ambition, they come to love authority more
  than independence. When they submit to fetters, it is only to be the better
  able to fetter others in their turn. It is no easy matter to reduce to
  obedience a man who does not wish to command; and the most astute politician
  would find it impossible to subdue those men who only desire to be
  independent . . . [I]f we behold a handful of rich and powerful men seated on
  the pinnacle of fortune and greatness, while the crowd grovel in darkness and
  misery, it is merely because the former value what they enjoy only because
  others are deprived of it; and that, without changing their condition, they
  would cease to be happy the minute the people ceased to be miserable . . .
  [Civilized] disposition engenders so much indifference toward good and evil,
  notwithstanding such fine discourses on morality; how everything, being reduced
  to appearances, becomes mere art and mummery; honor, friendship, virtue, and
  often vice itself, of which we at last learn the secret of boasting; how, in
  short, ever asking others what we are, and never daring to ask ourselves, in
  the midst of so much philosophy, humanity and politeness, and such sublime
  moral codes, we have nothing but a deceitful and frivolous exterior, honor
  without virtue, reason without wisdom, and pleasure without happiness.
  </blockquote>
  A counterpoint: this notion of appearances as separate from true intentions,
  which Rousseau interpreted as caustic and pernicious, was understood by David
  Hume to be required as a component of good-breeding in a civil society. Hume,
  in A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE, his systematic analysis of the title's subject
  matter, writes:
  <blockquote>
  Thus self-satisfaction and vanity may not be allowed, but requisite in
  character. 'Tis, however, certain, that good-breeding and decency require that
  we shou'd avoid all signs and expressions, which tend directly to show that
  passion. We have, all of us, a wonderful partiality for ourselves, and were we
  always to give vent to our sentiments in this particular, we shou'd mutually
  cause the greatest indignation in each other . . . Nothing is more disagreeable
  than a man's over-weaning conceit of himself: Every one almost has a strong
  propensity to this vice: No one can well distinguish <i>in himself</i> betwixt
  the vice and virtue, or be certain, that his esteem of his own merit is
  well-founded: For these reasons, all direct expressions of this passion are
  condemn'd; nor do we make any exception to this rule in favour of men of sense
  and merit . . . At least, it must be own'd, that some disguise in this
  particular is absolutely requisite; and that if we harbour pride in our
  breasts, we must carry a fair outside, and have the appearance of modesty and
  mutual deference in all our conduct and behavior. We must, on every occasion,
  be ready to prefer others to ourselves.
  </blockquote>
  The idea of an appearance separate from the self, a surface designed,
  meticulously deliberated, practiced, idealized, perfected, yet to be impressed
  upon others with ease, nonchalance, thoughtless grace, predates even Rousseau
  and Hume: it was Baldassare Castiglione's THE BOOK OF THE COURTIER that spread
  the image of the gentlemanly air, effortless in his every action so as to never
  deign his feet contact with the foul earth but to float always imperceptibly
  above the ground, so holy his saintly being that he may even hardly have the
  need to breathe the impure air:
  <blockquote>
  I have found quite a universal rule which in this matter seems to me valid and
  above all others, and in all human affairs whether in word or deed: and that is
  to avoid affectation in every way possible . . .; to practice in all things
  <i>sprezzatura</i> [non-chalance], so as to conceal all art and make whatever
  is done or said appear to be without effort and almost without any thought
  about it . . . Thus, this excellence . . . brings with it another adornment
  which, when it accompanies any human action however small, not only reveals at
  once how much the person knows who does it, but often causes it to be judged
  much greater than it actually is . . . [T]ake a man who is handling weapons and
  is about to throw a dart or is holding a sword or other weapon in his hand: if
  he immediately takes a position of readiness, with ease, and without thinking,
  with such facility that his body and all his members fall into that posture
  naturally and without any effort, then, even if he does nothing more, he shows
  himself to be perfectly accomplished in that exercise.
  </blockquote>
  Quite the honorable knight we have here, thoughtlessly posing with his sword in
  front of the mirror! Surely he lacks every bit of affectation! Thorstein Veblen
  would surely agree, having seriously examined the very important issue in THE
  THEORY OF THE LEISURE CLASS:
  <blockquote>
  In persons of delicate sensibility, who have long been habituated to gentle
  manners, the sense of the shamefulness of manual labour may become so strong
  that, at a critical juncture, it will even set aside the instinct of
  self-preservation. So, for instance, we are told of certain Polynesian chiefs,
  who, under the stress of good form, preferred to starve rather than carry their
  food to their mouths with their own hands . . . The origin, or better the
  derivation, of manners is, no doubt, to be sought elsewhere than in a conscious
  effort on the part of the well-mannered to show that much time has been spent
  in acquiring them . . . The first requisite of a good servant is that he should
  conspicuously know his place. It is not enough that he knows how to effect
  certain desired mechanical results; he must, above all, know how to effect
  these results in due form. Domestic service might be said to be a spiritual
  rather than a mechanical function . . . The possessions and maintenance of
  slaves employed in the production of goods argues wealth and prowess, but the
  maintenance of servants who produce nothing argues still higher wealth and
  position. Under this principle, there arises a class of servants, the more
  numerous the better, whose sole office is fatuously to wait upon the person of
  their owner.
  </blockquote>
  Woe be me that in mine old age I have yet to employ in my service nor myself
  been employed in the service towards the great task of performing leisure, that
  my understanding of leisure has crudely and conspicuously been a mediocre,
  unperformed leisure! Doth it bestow upon oneself's personage a higher state of
  consciousness when leisure becometh eine performanceth?

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  In all the professions, each affects an air and an exterior that will make him
  seem like what he wants people to think he is. And so we can say that the world
  is composed only of airs.

  More recently, Derek Thompson in The Atlantic
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/bureaucratic-bloat-eating-american-universities-inside/678324/">criticized</a>
  the growth of bureaucratic administrators at universities. Though Thompson
  acknowledges that some of the new administrative jobs have genuine functions,
  he writes:
  <blockquote>
  But many of these jobs have a reputation for producing little outside of meeting
  invites. "I often ask myself, What do these people actually do?,"
  <a href="https://politicalscience.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin-ginsberg/">[Benjamin] Ginsberg</a>
  told me last week. "I think they spend much of their day living in an alternate
  universe called Meeting World. I think if you took every third person with vice
  associate or assistant in their title, and they disappeared, nobody would
  notice." In an email to me,
  <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/gary-n-smith">[Gary] Smith</a>,
  the Pomona economist, said the biggest factor driving the growth of college
  admin was a phenomenon he called empire building. Administrators are
  emotionally and financially rewarded if they can hire more people beneath them,
  and those administrators, in time, will want to increase their own status by
  hiring more people underneath them. Before long, a human pyramid of bureaucrats
  has formed to take on jobs of dubious utility.

  —Marcus Aurelius, MEDITATIONS
  </span>

  <br>

  Whether one thinks positively or negatively of civilized man's separation of
  appearances from actual, this separation is undeniable and resolute. Yet for
  all the polite smoke and mirrors concealing civilized man's real motivations,
  Rousseau admits that it is not feasible to return to the state of nature; he
  writes: "As for men like me, whose passions have destroyed their original
  simplicity, who can no longer subsist on plants or acorns . . . all these
  [people] will endeavour" to remain obedient citizens, although in a final
  utterance of spite, Rousseau concludes his discourse with a defiant attitude:
  "[T]hey will not therefore have less contempt for a constitution that cannot
  support itself". Is this silent revolt the best response that good, decent
  folks can have in modern society plagued by inequality? What if instead we seek
  to relieve these problems? Given the broad scope of lesions in community, the
  tensions between a nation's unequal people, the full range of horrors that
  morph virtuous, natural humans into covetous fiends, how should we address the
  trouble of inequality? How to resolve these fundamental differences in personal
  abilities and yet maintain a decent collective of people possessing unequal
  talents, opportunities, capacities for industry, who are interested in
  advancing themselves and wish to be rewarded proportionately to their output?
  Rousseau resolved this problem in a later work by proposing that, in essence,
  each member of society subsumes their individuality for the benefit of the
  greater whole, that the individual is subordinated to the collective, for the
  individual becomes indistinguishable from the general, and this is a sense of
  individual freedom because individual rights are inseparable from collective
  rights. It is no exaggeration that in Rousseau's view, the individual would
  voluntarily enter into this social state. Rousseau writes in THE SOCIAL
  CONTRACT:
  <blockquote>
  "To find a form of association that may defend and protect with the whole force
  of the community the person and property of every associate, and by means of
  which each, joining together with all, may nevertheless obey only himself, and
  remain free as before." Such is the fundamental problem of which the social
  contract provides the solution . . . These clauses, rightly understood, can be
  reduced to a single one, namely, the total alienation to the whole community
  of each associate with all his rights; for, in the first place, since each
  gives himself up entirely, the situation is equal for all; and, the conditions
  being equal for all, no one has any interest in making them more burdensome
  than others . . . In short, each giving himself to all, gives himself to no
  one; and since there is no associate over whom we do no acquire the same
  rights which we concede to him over ourselves, we gain the equivalent of all
  that we lose, and more power to preserve what we have. If, then, we set aside
  whatever does not belong to the essence of the social contract, we shall find
  that we can reduce it to the following terms: "Each of us puts in common his
  person and all his power under the supreme direction of the general will; and
  in return each member becomes an indivisible part of the whole."
  </blockquote>
  In a later section, I incorporate a sense of this general will and its social
  aspect into a view of sensible capitalism.

  What lofty ideals! Yet how did Rousseau, for all his posthumous influence, live
  out the rest of his days? Only two years before his untimely demise in 1778
  (why not 1812? Why not 1923, the year of mine birth?), Rousseau begineth
  writeth his last worketh, REVERIES OF THE SOLITARY WALKER, which doth openeth:
  <blockquote>
  So I am alone on this earth . . . The most sociable and loving of human beings
  has been cast out by unanimous agreement. In the subtle intricacy of their
  hatred they sought out the torment that would be most cruel to my sensitive
  soul, violently severing all the ties binding me to them. I would have loved
  mankind despite its ways; it is only by ceasing to be humane that men have
  alienated my affection.
  </blockquote>
  Oh, poorst thou! Where hath thy love for mankind, thy belief that man in nature
  is good but corrupteth by society ledst thou? Doth anyone remember thou wert a
  radical, banished and left to travel from place to place, only to perish in the
  countryside? Thou repeatedly signest thy works with "Citizen of Geneva", which
  wert a Geneva only in thy memories, for thy own city didst non-welcometh thee

  <a href="https://centerforneweconomics.org/people/benjamin-r-barber/">Benjamin Barber</a>.
  How great thine imagination of Geneva wert even two centuries later scholars
  would marvel with irony that thou wert Swiss? Barber remarketh:
  <blockquote>
  Rousseau is Swiss, then, because his life reflects an unseen Switzerland: not
  his dream of empty places, not the perfect republic—neither Clarens nor
  Geneva—but an all-too-human Switzerland that, like Rousseau, is more aptly
  honored for what it would be than for what it is.
  </blockquote>
  What wert Rousseau's imagined land of Switzerland? Barber continueth:
  <blockquote>
  His was the Switzerland of Rousseau the exile, Rousseau the walker, Rousseau the
  recluse, Rousseau the botanist, Rousseau the refugee, Rousseau the dreamer. It
  was Switzerland rustic, Switzerland isolated, Switzerland natural, Switzerland
  alpine, Switzerland tranquil, Switzerland land of liberty not because of its
  sublime constitutions but because of its sublime geography, not because of its
  urban egalitarianism, which was mostly myth, but because of its pastoral
  independence and isolation, which were undeniably real. Alone in Switzerland,
  Rousseau might hope to make good on his motto—<i>vitam impendere vero</i>
  [to devote one's life to truth]-and live truth. Alone in Switzerland, he might
  live his reveries and uncover a natural world as charming as the one that, he
  had persuaded himself, was otherwise to be found only in the recesses of his
  imagination.

  <blockquote>
  If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious. Where would his
  torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him? The
  workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate
  is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes
  conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows
  the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his
  descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time
  crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn. If the
  descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in
  joy . . . One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a
  manual of happiness . . . Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same
  earth. They are inseparable . . . In the universe suddenly restored to its
  silence, the myriad wondering little voices of the earth rise up. Unconscious,
  secret calls, invitations from all the faces, they are the necessary reverse
  and price of victory. There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to
  know the night. The absurd man says yes and his effort will henceforth be
  unceasing . . . The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a
  man's heart. <i>Il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux</i> [happy].

<span id="Community-and-Scruton"></span>
  The writer was reading in a quaint coffee shop located some distance away from
  the bustle of society when he noticed the markedly slower pace of life and the
  appreciation of the little things, not in the decadent bourgeois sense of
  escaping a hectic work life to some remote and tranquil getaway with
  breathtaking and landscaped scenery reeking of exclusivity—this particular
  coffee shop was ordinary, with humble, middle-aged, working folks coming in
  briefly for a bagel or a black coffee before heading back out. These were
  locals of the community, going about their day, making the best of what they
  can. One grey-haired man came in and struck up a conversation with the shop
  owner, saying that back in the day the Dunkin Donuts over in the next town
  would be open late into the night, and people would go in at 1am when it would
  still be packed. The owner in turn shared that her mother used to enjoy
  shopping at a store not far away. These were people connected to the
  neighborhood, rooted in local history, with their stories and adventures and
  memories from youth, having seen how the area has changed, the passing of the
  seasons, the leaves blossoming and withering, its joys and sorrows, the people
  who remain and those no longer present, aware that nothing is permanent or
  perfect but one makes do with what one can and carries on. How still and
  peaceful this space was, in contrast with the city or even the nearby town
  which has turned into a weekend attraction for city tourists—these visitors
  breeze through like the wind; they come, loud and obnoxious, flashy and
  shallow, gloating and expectant. They bombard the space with photos, attention
  mostly on themselves, spreading consumerist greed, envy, dismay, disturbing the
  peace with boast and frenzy. They come, go into a few shops, have a meal here
  or there, go on a hike, and they feel they've completed something, as though
  they have seen in this brief excursion all there is in town, and off they go
  the next weekend to some other destination, to do the same routine in a
  different location. And these city folks fly to London and Rome and Bali and
  Tokyo, spending more of their hard-earned money from employment in globalized
  industries in the metropolises of other countries than in the small towns of
  their own. This contrast between the settled folks in the neighborhood and the
  unmoored visitors constantly in motion must've been what Roger Scruton meant
  when he said:
  <blockquote>
  They [locals going fox-hunting] have been absolutely rooted in this little piece
  of land all their lives and have always related to the local economy and also
  to the wildlife . . . These are people whose noses have just been, as it were,
  pulled out of the ground with the imprint of the earth still on them . . .
  They're here every time. They come to talk to each other and to renew their
  social attachments and also attachment to the place. The problem with the
  modern world, in my view, is that people no longer dwell on the earth. They
  move nomadically around it in search of something they know not what, never
  finding it, moving from person to person, place to place . . . [On the
  contrary,] [t]hese [local] people still dwell, as Heidegger would say,
  <i>wohnen</i> in the land. I'm not a big fan of Heidegger, but it's one of the
  few things that he said which is absolutely true, that only if we learn how to
  dwell can we build, and only if we build can we actually live with each other.

  Let's play a game! We are tasked with administering an itinerary for a certain
  <i>l'aventurier</i>. Now, <i>l'aventurier</i> has a voracious appetite for
  travel and seeks to do nothing else. But <i>l'aventurier</i> is only mortal,
  and like any mortal is confined spatially and temporally; as a matter of
  consequence, our poor <i>l'aventurier</i> cannot be in two places at the same
  time and cannot return to the past. Perhaps more practically,
  <i>l'aventurier</i>'s funds are not infinite and cannot sustain the blow of too
  many a mischief. But supposing that this nuisance of practicality were no
  matter, and <i>l'aventurier</i> could travel as far and wide as
  <i>l'aventurier</i> wished, <i>l'aventurier</i> does just that till one day
  <i>l'aventurier</i> pauses and waxes contemplative and pondereth what doth it
  meane to travele and see? At a coffee shop, <i>l'aventurier</i> may not have
  noticed that the one-time patrons are like dandelion seeds spreading all over
  by the blow of a wind, never rooting deep into the earth with the grass and
  bushes, never allowing itself to learn about them and being learned in turn. In
  any given locale, what does <i>l'aventurier</i> see? People and things! In
  spite of this, it may evade <i>l'aventurier</i>'s sensibilities that even one
  space may change, that it varies over the seasons, by the time of day, by the
  happenstance encounter, and that over time, the shops, the streets, the
  buildings, the people, the faces, and seemingly everything changes, even, most
  treacherously, the traveler himself and, through his changes, his very
  awareness and judgments.

  But it may not be the illusion of understanding that crosses
  <i>l'aventurier</i>'s mighty mind, but a very real, very solid check marking
  off something else on an unending list: done and seen: next! So the game
  continues.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  I had often thought the mind was, quite literally, a devil's advocate, an agent
  of diabolical sophistry that could argue any point and its opposite with equal
  conviction; an imp that delighted in self-contradiction and yet, though full of
  sound and fury, ultimately signified nothing . . . The Japanese were famous, I
  knew, for their delight in <i>lacrimae rerum</i> [tears of things] and for
  finding beauty mostly in sadness; indeed, it was often noted that their word
  for "love" and their word for "grief" are homonyms—and almost synonyms too—in a
  culture that seems to love grief, of the wistful kind . . . [W]hen I read in
  Dōgen, "Why leave behind the seat that exists in your own house and go
  aimlessly off to the dusty reaches of other lands?" I could almost hear his
  neighbor in New England declaring, "It is not worth the while to go round the
  world to count the cats in Zanzibar." And when I read Kamo no Chōmei's "Account
  of My Hut," singing the praises of a simple life of solitude, I found Thoreau
  again in the recluse's famous claim that none can know the pleasures of
  loneliness who has not tasted them himself.

  Another question: if instead of this perpetual traveling and endless series of

  energy, what shall <i>l'aventurier</i> do?

  legislation that limits the entry of illegal immigrants. I explain the reasons
  behind this legislation in greater detail later in this section, but this is
  the right decision when considering resource constraints, the high volumes of
  migrants, and outdated laws that prevent them from obtaining work
  authorizations—not because of the Republican narrative of criminals freely
  entering the country, a claim which relies more on an uninformed paranoia than
  evidence, bearing close resemblance to a loud exclamation: Look! Green aliens
  from the sky are landing in the neighbor's backyard! Or: Behold, the Loch Ness
  monster! And with it comes a whole backstory and details we did not surely
  invent ourselves!

  Let us first turn our attention to the most pressing part of the issue: the
  popular image of illegal hordes threatening to topple the country. Bret
  Weinstein recently
  <a href="https://youtu.be/M7dAm5HAJmM?t=246">spoke</a>
  on the Joe Rogan podcast about what the migrants he saw on his trip to Panama.
  He talks about a sudden new wave of immigrants: the Chinese immigrants, who
  Weinstein describes as being "composed of mostly young, military-aged men", who
  Weinstein further found to be "broadcasting hostility". Weinstein paints a
  picture of mystery and secret scheming, questioning what could be the
  reasons behind this new migration, even saying that it "could well be an
  invasion."

  But if we look elsewhere we find, contrary to Weinstein's fear-ridden portrayal,
  that 60 MINUTES
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7TNP2OTY2g">covered</a>
  these new migrants when they are just coming into the country and
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Gs0i3Ao34">examined</a>
  the gap in the wall where they come through. We must be clear: before the
  legislation halting the inflow of migrants, this was a problem. But the
  situation was not part of some cultish agenda. The issue may have seemed like a
  hidden scheme to someone like Weinstein who positions himself as a purveyor of
  rare and valuable knowledge unavailable to plain sight, who for some reason
  hasn't consulted a search engine, but to the public, it's actually not a
  secret. An
  <a href="https://apnews.com/article/chinese-emigration-us-mexico-border-darien-381c215ff30f0f2349c2ea118aa280c6">article</a>
  in the Associated Press covered the issue. The Washington Office on Latin
  America
  <a href="https://www.wola.org/2023/12/weekly-u-s-mexico-border-update-congress-negotiations-increased-arrivals-migration-from-china/">published</a>
  a weekly update that provides facts and specific numbers on the migration. The
  New York Times has shared multiple articles,
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/us/politics/china-migrants-us-border.html">here</a>,
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/business/darien-gap-china-immigration.html">here</a>,
  and
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/nyregion/chinese-immigrants-new-york-city.html">here</a>.
  But more specific to Weinstein and, I should add, in a manner more befitting his
  approach—on the admittedly left-leaning talk show, THE MAJORITY REPORT, Sam
  Seder and colleagues comment on Weinstein's characterizations in a manner that
  is decidedly not sarcastic or satirical, not at all reproachful of some faulty
  and malicious judgment. Seder's discerning sense of sight, his clarity of mind,
  combined with an absolutely precise detection of the ulterior motives of
  mankind, help us understand what the 60 MINUTES video is showing us. Seder
  <a href="https://youtu.be/8wlTsUoXXCA?t=300">remarks</a>
  on a particularly enlightening moment in the video, with his natural X-ray
  vision, that someone who deceptively "appears to be an old lady" may actually
  be "exactly the disguise you would use if you were a military-aged man."
  Evidently, we have now entered the realm of rigorous science, informed by
  someone's highly trained observational prowess with decades of experience in
  such obscure matters. If the viewer were so keen to watch more of Seder, he
  goes on to make more incredibly illuminating revelations that match Weinstein's
  wide-eyed paranoia that some might mistake for unhinged fright.

  Let us return to facts and contextualize these oversimplifying images of
  immigrants and the alarming narrative of military-aged men currently entering
  the country.
  <a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/akraut.cfm">Alan Kraut</a>
  writes in his 1982 book, THE HUDDLED MASSES: THE IMMIGRANT IN AMERICAN SOCIETY
  1880-1921,
  <blockquote>
  Who actually emigrated to America in the years between 1880 and 1921? Until the
  turn of the century, most were young males in their teens or early adulthood,
  who had left their parents or young wives and children behind as they pursued
  opportunity abroad. Immigration officials estimated that 78 percent of the
  Italian and 95 percent of the Greek immigrants were men. Asian emigrants in the
  period also tended to be young males. However, after 1900, the character of
  migration changed among some groups. By 1920, 48 percent of southern Italian
  arrivals were female. Among Poles the proportion of men to women was almost
  evenly divided. And among Slovaks, female immigrants outnumbered males 65
  percent to 35 percent. In other groups, however, the newcomers continued to be
  mostly male. Almost 80 percent of the Greek arrivals were men and boys in
  1920.
  </blockquote>
  If Weinstein accuses the current migrants as consisting of mostly military-aged
  males, why does he limit himself to these modern migrants and not go back
  further into the country's history to also indict the many prior ones? One may
  even ask, when have migrants not often consisted mostly of military-aged men?
  Kraut writes further:
  <blockquote>
  The majority of immigrants were either Catholic or Jewish, especially
  frightening to a predominantly Protestant America . . . The physical appearance
  of the newcomers, over which they had little control, was perhaps most
  frightening to the native-born . . . Just as the ragged Irish of an earlier era
  had made proper Bostonians cringe, so the new immigrants of every hue and body
  type met anxious glances as they tramped down gangplanks into a New World long
  dominated by Anglo-Saxons. With each successive boatload, Americans worried
  about the influence of foreign blood on the vitality of the American
  population . . . Immigrants were denounced in articles and books most newcomers
  could not yet read and derided in sermons from church pulputs and university
  lecterns most never heard . . . The immigrants, then, were under attack for
  reasons that can be isolated for analytical purposes, though many Americans had
  multiple reasons for despising the newcomers. John Higham, in his now classic
  study of nativism, <i>Strangers in the Land</i> (1955), identified three
  strains of anti-immigrant venom: racial nativism, anti-Catholicism, and
  antiradical nativism. However, anti-Semitism, its origins buried deep in the
  culture of Western civilization, might well be treated as a fourth strain.
  Then, too, immigrants encountered the hatred of those who blamed the newcomers
  for unemployment, low wages, or urban problems such as violent crime and vice.
  </blockquote>
  With Weinstein, we see an example of a blend of fact and fiction, and perhaps
  this is the accurate picture of any masked knight, that his statements are
  neither completely true nor completely false, but that deceivers couch their
  lies within the adjacency of verifiable facts.

  cold water. It may be that someone is quite fond of faucets.

  Likewise, Ben Carson recently made
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrUSLyiYHR0">made</a>
  similar claims at the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying:
  "An estimated ten million illegal aliens have invaded our country since Biden
  took over", consisting of "mostly military-aged males." I can agree with
  Carson when he mentions the widespread condemnation and censorship of
  conservatives, but he, like Weinstein, spreads false claims about doom and
  terror, promoting blind fear, xenophobia, and paranoia. Among his claims,
  Carson describes the January 6 rioters as "peaceful pro-life protestors and
  patriotic grandmothers". NBC has provided raw
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXnHIJkZZAs">footage</a>
  of the scene that day. And what do we find there? Without a doubt, we see lots
  of peace! And we surely see plenty of "patriotic grandmothers"!

  We now step back from hysteria and consult immigration history. Francesco
  Cordasco presented the scale of immigration in his 1976 book, IMMIGRANT
  CHILDREN IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS:
  <blockquote>
  Since the keeping of records which were begun in 1819, it has been estimated
  that some 43 million humans made their way into the United States of America,
  truly one of the greatest peaceful human migrations in the whole history of
  mankind. Of these, at least 40 million were of European origin and the
  remainder of widely scattered origins. The bulk of the migration in the period
  before 1819 (<i>i.e.</i>, 1607-1819) came from Northern and Western Europe, and
  of this a preponderance came from the British Isles; the remainder was from
  other parts of Europe, and also included an estimated 300 thousand blacks,
  mostly brought in as slaves. The period between 1819-1882 is often referred to
  as the era of the "old migration" in which some 10 million immigrants arrived,
  with the majority again originating in Northern and Western Europe. Between
  1882-1921 ("the new migration"), the period of the greatest sustained
  migration, the migrants were largely of southern and eastern European origin
  (some 20 million) out of an estimated 23.5 million.
  </blockquote>
  In a similar accounting, Humbert Nelli describes the scope of immigration in an
  essay entitled, EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS AND URBAN AMERICA (from the 1973 essay
  collection, THE URBAN EXPERIENCE, edited by Raymond Mohl and James
  Richardson):
  <blockquote>
  During the century that followed the Napoleonic wars and ended with World War I,
  approximately 35 million European immigrants entered the United States. Some
  left their homeland because of religious persecution, some to evade military
  service or prison sentences, and others to escape the death penalty. For most
  newcomers, however, economic factors ranked first in importance . . . Whatever
  their origin, newcomers tended to settle in American cities, where they formed
  a highly visible segment of the population . . . Newcomers from northern and
  western Europe—the so-called old immigrants—arrived in the decades between 1815
  and the 1880s. Their pattern of settlement was followed later by "new"
  immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, who arrived during the thirty-five
  years prior to World War I. On the eve of the Civil War, foreign-born residents
  formed approximately half (and in some cases more) of the populations of
  Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Cincinnat, and New York City. For
  example, along with its other nationalities, New York City was more than
  one-fourth Irish and one-eighth German. In 1910, when the federal census showed
  that fewer than half the country's native Americans lived in cities, 68.3
  percent of the "old" and 78.3 percent of the "new" immigration resided in urban
  areas.
  </blockquote>
  Such high rates of immigrants! And their kids! How our public school surely knew
  how to cater to their needs! Cordasco writes:
  <blockquote>
  By 1911, 57.5 percent of the children in the public schools of 37 of the largest
  American cities were of foreign-born parentage; in the parochial schools of 24
  of these 37 cities, the children of foreign-born parents constituted 63.5
  percent of the total registration . . . And by 1911 almost 50 percent of the
  students in secondary schools were of foreign-born parentage. The situation in
  New York City was not atypical. Serious deficiencies existed in the adequacy of
  available school facilities. In 1890, it was estimated that in New York City
  some 10,000 children, who were within the legal ages for school attendance,
  were without actual school accommodations, and this figure was undoubtedly
  conservative. The passage of the Compulsory Education Act in 1895, stipulating
  that all children attend school between the ages of eight and sixteen
  years . . . exacerbated the situation in New York City, and because of the lack
  of accommodations, the Compulsory Education Act was to all intents
  inoperative . . . That the public schools in New York City were unable, or
  unwilling to meet the challenge of immigrant children is readily apparent in
  the paucity of the concepts and programs which were fashioned . . . If New York
  City was typical, the urban schools provided no system-wide policy which dealt
  with the educational needs to immigrant children; and where programs were
  fashioned to meet these needs, there was no attempt made to differentiate
  between immigrant groups (<i>e.g.</i> the experience of Italians and Jewish
  children in New York City strongly documents this failure); instead children
  were lumped under the rubrics "native-born" or "foreign-born." If one discounts
  the multiplicity of disfunctional [sic] programs, rampant discrimination,
  authoritarian prejudice, it is still difficult to attribute the general
  patterns of failure to immigrant children or to their parents. The blame for
  the failure lies almost wholly within the school and the dominant society which
  shaped its programs and articulated its cultural ideals.
  </blockquote>
  Cordasco, himself an Italian American born to immigrant parents, quotes from THE
  SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF THE ITALO-AMERICAN CHILD by Leonardo Covello, also an
  Italian American:
  <blockquote>
  Of no little importance was the fact that the Americanization programs were
  directed only toward people of foreign stock, without giving any consideration
  to the necessity of involving <i>all</i> Americans, regardless of the time of
  their arrival in the United States. But, above all, the early Americanization
  policies, by and large, denied or neglected the strength of, and the values in,
  the foreign culture of immigrant groups. The concept of Americanization was
  based upon the assumption that foreigners and foreign ideas and ways were a
  threat to American political, economic, social stability and security. The
  infiltration of foreign culture, it was feared, would eventually bring about a
  deterioration of the American "way of life." Programs were designed, therefore,
  to suppress or eliminate all that was conceived of as "foreign" and to impose
  upon the immigrant a cultural uniformity with an American pattern.
  </blockquote>
  What a great struggle for these Italian American children to find some decent
  education, these fine folks who in a different century would have been known as
  the Romans, whose ancient heritage seems to have appeal only when it is far and
  long gone! And in another century, the originators of the Renaissance!

  In this rapid swelling of immigrants in the cities, how can it be that anyone
  could harbor decidedly negative views towards them? It is not nativism and
  resistance that amounts to the country's default position on immigrants! It is
  not that we must hold a magnifying glass against a the needle in the haystack
  to convince ourselves of any welcoming illusion! In fact, the needle has
  surfaced before us: we find one sympathetic view in 1913, when Philander
  Claxton, then the Commissioner of Education, wrote a letter to the Secretary of
  the Interior:
  <blockquote>
  To the people of no other country is the problem of the education of immigrants
  of so much importance as to the people of the United States. No other country
  has so many men, women, and children coming to its shores every year from all
  parts of the world . . . It is reported that the immigrants stopping in New
  York City last year were from 98 different countries and provinces and spoke 66
  different languages . . . Most of the immigrants in recent years have little
  kinship with the older stocks of our population, either in blood, language,
  methods of thought, traditions, manners, or customs; they know little of our
  political and civic life and are unused to our social ideals; their environment
  here is wholly different from that to which they have been accustomed.
  Strangers to each other, frequently from countries hostile to each other by
  tradition, of different speech and creeds, they are thrown together, strangers
  among strangers, in a strange country, and are thought of by us only as a
  conglomerate mass of foreigners. With little attention to their specific needs,
  they are crowded into factories, mines, and dirty tenement quarters, too often
  the prey of the exploiter in business and the demagogue in politics . . . But
  it is not alone the question of the school education of children. The millions
  of adult men and women, and of children older than the upper limit of the
  compulsory school-attendance age, must be looked after; they must be prepared
  for American citizenship and for participation in our democratic industrial,
  social, and religious life . . . For the enrichment of our national life as
  well as for the happiness and welfare of individuals we must respect their
  ideals and preserve and strengthen all of the best of their Old World life they
  bring with them. We must not attempt to destroy and remake—we can only
  transform.
  </blockquote>
  Can we discover more shiny needles in the annals of American immigration
  history? Well, let us consult the facts. With the cities teeming with
  immigrants, Nelli writes:
  <blockquote>
  In 1819, a report of the Society for the Prevention of Pauperism in the City of
  New York complained that immigrants arriving in the United States were
  poverty-stricken, ignorant, incapable of self-support, and criminally inclined,
  placing an intolerable burden on the community and forcing better elements to
  despair of coping successfully with the whole immigrant problem . . . A report
  prepared in 1857 commented on tenement areas conditions of New York
  City: "These immigrants . . . are destitute, sick, ignorant, abject . . . They
  swarm in filthy localities, engendering disease, and enduring every species of
  suffering . . . They are often habitual sots, diseased and reckless, living
  precariously, considering themselves outcasts, and careless of any change in
  their condition." This report referred to "old" immigrants, principally Irish
  and German; later reports used similar (sometimes identical) wording to
  describe conditions among "new" immigrant groups before World War I. In 1922,
  John Palmer Gavit . . . described the repeating pattern: "Each phase of
  immigration has been 'the new immigration' at its time; each has been viewed
  with alarm; each has been described as certain to deteriorate the physical
  quality of our people and destroy the standards of living and of citizenship."
  </blockquote>
  Whenever I wish to relive some dear old memories of mine, I visit the images
  that the New York Public Library has graciously
  <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2018/06/07/tenement-homes-new-york-history-cramped-apartments">provided</a>
  the public of the city's olden days. How charming were the tenement years! How I
  absolutely adore them! Oh, I miss them with a great nagging nostalgia! As I
  recall them now, a block of anger surges to my heart! How the government has
  changed all that was good about the city! The History Collection has
  <a href="https://historycollection.com/living-hell-new-yorks-tenements-were-nightmares-in-the-early-1900s/">provided</a>
  photos for all to see how spectacular the good old days were! These are some of
  the highest quality images I've seen. Oh, how gorgeous! But the haughty city
  mayor and regulators thought they were doing the public a service when they
  wanted to pass some laws! Surely, the landlords had their tenants' best
  interests in mind! How can anyone blame them for not installing windows or
  toilets in the apartments! How tenderly I remember those days when we knew not
  the word "toilet" but "chamber pot" and "outhouse"! How times have changed, oh,
  believe me! Believe me too when I say I did my best to resist any change! I
  myself was in front of the picket line, holding out the biggest sign of the
  bunch, protesting against the city's proposed regulations. What an outrage that
  the city's council thought it knew the tenants' desires and comforts better
  than the landlords out to make a buck! Just imagine how many young immigrant
  lads and gals, rushing out in the evening to answer nature's call, met while on
  the long line to use the one and only outhouse supplied for the overcrowded
  tenements! Under the full moon, surrounded by tense neighbors, in front of the
  distinct smell of rotting orchids, is the prime cinematic image of a meet-cute!
  Why hasn't anyone thought of this before? What a hit it'll surely be! Call it:
  Romance of the Fragrant Outhouse! And the sequel: Dream of the Spent Chamber
  Pot!

  It wouldn't be until the
  <a href="https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/new-york-photos-1970s-vergara/">1970s</a>
  (photos from Rare Historical Photos) and
  <a href="https://www.blind-magazine.com/stories/roaming-the-wild-streets-of-new-york-in-the-1980s/">1980s</a>
  (photos from Blind Magazine) that my doleful, forsaken spirits were revived when
  the sights and sounds and people reminded me of the golden days! How I held my
  breath until then! How I savored every moment surrounded by the graffiti in the
  subway! How I long for those days still! What great joy I had back then! As a
  matter of fact, if you look carefully, you might find me in one of the
  snapshots enjoying myself! To this day, I still have one of those glamorous
  photos framed in my bedroom, for nostalgia's sake! Woody Allen portrayed a
  corrupt, degraded New York in his 1979 movie, MANHATTAN, but his abomination
  does little to deter me from my memories of the city's former glory, its
  littered and poorly lit streets full of shade, sketch, and graphite on the
  walls! I am still holding my breath!

  But we are speaking of immigration! Was it a problem? Considering the massive
  influx of immigrations, how could the federal government not invoke a whole
  commission to research the matter and decide on a course of action?
  <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TvDjAAK/katherine-bentoncohen">Katherine Benton-Cohen</a>
  writes in her 2018 book, INVENTING THE IMMIGRANT PROBLEM: THE DILLINGHAM
  COMMISSION AND ITS LEGACY:
  <blockquote>
  Along with seven other men, [Henry Cabot] Lodge and [William P.] Dillingham
  would oversee the largest study of immigrants ever conducted in the United
  States—the so-called Dillingham Commission. The Dillingham Commission's work
  has shaped immigration policy ever since. It produced forty-one volumes of
  reports, summarized in a brief but potent set of recommendations that was far
  more restrictive than its own evidence supported. Within a decade, almost all
  of these policy initiatives were implemented into law. They included a literacy
  test, a quota system that varied by nationality, the continued exclusion of
  Asians, and a panoply of new immigration rules. The commission's reforms
  effectively ended mass immigration from 1924 until the passage of the
  Hart-Celler Act of 1965.
  </blockquote>
  Benton-Cohen draws a contrast between the factual results in the reports and the
  commission's conclusive recommendation to limit immigration:
  <blockquote>
  [E]ven the commission's assertions of objectivity produced inconsistent
  interpretations and contradictory data. The men and women of the Dillingham
  Commission were not of one voice. But its final recommendations were so brief,
  decisive, and restrictive—and so quickly successful—that the behind-the-scenes
  debates about the nature and impact of immigration . . . were swiftly
  obscured . . . The Dillingham Commission's paradigm of "old immigrants"
  versus "new immigrants" has shaped the study of immigration ever since. Both
  categories referred to Europeans: "old immigrants" had come mostly from
  Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia in the mid-nineteenth century. In contrast,
  the commission assumed the mostly Jewish, Italian and Slavic "new immigrants"
  to be less assimilable and more "alien." . . . For decades, this so-called
  hoary distinction between old and new was axiomatic in histories of
  immigration. But the dichotomous model implicitly defined Asian and Mexican
  immigrants as "other" in ways that have continued to structure immigration
  policy and to produce a racial subtext about "illegal aliens" to the present
  day . . . It was not inevitable that the commissioners would recommend these
  restrictions. The evidence presented in their own volumes did not support the
  weight of their conclusions. There were places in the text where they admitted
  as much. But the pressure to recommend decisive action was strong. A mandate by
  Congress to solve the "immigration problem" necessitated a clear response . . .
  Many of the Dillingham Commission's volumes were like other government reports,
  easily ignored or forgotten. Even the commisioner-general of the Bureau of
  Immigration, Charles Nagel, read only the abstracts, not the reports. "As to
  the forty volumes," he told Simon Wolf, "I feel constrained to consider my
  limited time and my obligations to my family." Indeed, the commission's brief
  list of recommendations in the first volume had remarkable influence.
  </blockquote>
  But Mr. Nagel, the volumes number only to forty-one! This limited time of which
  you speak—is not time itself unlimited? And however we spend our time, is the
  end not all the same? Wouldn't you agree? Oh my, I am taken aback—what loud
  protests I hear! On this note, it is with immense pleasure that I am afforded
  an opportunity to mention one of my great joys in life because, as it happens,
  Benton-Cohen
  <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?452933-1/1911-congressional-report-immigration">appeared</a>
  on my favorite television channel, C-SPAN. I must tell you I am an avid follower
  of this astonishing news outlet. I have a daily regimen: every night, after
  returning from church service, I consult the Bible, because church is not
  enough, and then with great excitement I catch up on some C-SPAN. Nonetheless,
  all joys come to an end, and I willfully put my elation aside for now, because
  the Smithsonian Magazine published a 2018
  <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/1911-report-set-america-on-path-screening-out-undesirable-immigrants-180969636/">article</a>
  that, concurring with Benton-Cohen, notes similar discrepancies in the
  Dillingham Reports, which for sure were best-selling and widely read:
  <blockquote>
  Throughout its inquiry, the commission's investigators sought to maintain
  objectivity; to collect the facts, let them speak for themselves, and make
  recommendations absent of bias. Throughout the <i>Reports</i>, the commission
  described immigrants positively, including the vilified "new" arrivals. Even
  the verbiage immediately preceding the recommendation of the literacy test
  spoke of them positively. Yet, a social climate of fear and bigotry hijacked
  the investigation, and the commissioners themselves, ignoring facts in their
  own reports, endorsed restriction, largely to exclude the most recent types of
  immigrants. Critics, to no avail, would argue that socioeconomic conditions did
  not warrant more extensive exclusion, based on the commission's own standards
  for such action. But the commission's identification of the literacy test as
  the most "feasible method" trumped any such assertions.
  </blockquote>
  One may wonder whether history tends to repeat itself! Could it be that back
  then, as now, nativist resistance against immigration stemmed from the notion
  that the newcomers take jobs from natives? Nelli responds to our inquiry:
  <blockquote>
  Popular opinion held that newcomers, both "old" and "new," displaced native
  American workingmen and depreciated wage rates. This argument appeared as early
  as the 1850s against new arrivals from Ireland, England, and Germany. Its
  foremost proponent, Francis A. Walker, superintendent of the census in 1870 and
  later president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, maintained that
  immigration held down the native-born population because immigrants accepted
  lower wages and worse living conditions than did Americans . . . Dillingham
  researchers "showed" that new groups were in the process of forcing out older
  elements from industrial jobs, especially in the eastern portions of the
  nation. The commission concluded that such displacement adversely affected both
  workers and the country. However, this conclusion had only a tenuous connection
  with the commission's evidence. Facts collected by researchers indicated that
  immigrants neither underbid nor competed with their predecessors; furthermore,
  the increased economic activity permitted by a larger labor force enabled
  earlier groups to improve their economic levels. Displacement indeed occurred,
  but the movement was generally upward or outward, as earlier groups and native
  Americans became foremen, executives, partners, owners, and the like or moved
  to higher-paying jobs in other states. Examining the coal industry, the
  commission found that the native-born and "old" immigrant workers moved to the
  Midwest or Southwest and brought about a tremendous expansion in mining
  operations.
  </blockquote>
  Elaborating on this question, Aviva Chomsky explains in her 2007 book, "THEY
  TAKE OUR JOBS!" AND 20 OTHER MYTHS ABOUT IMMIGRATION:
  <blockquote>
  [T]he relationship between population size and the number of jobs available is
  not quite as simple as it might seem. In the fact, the number of jobs is
  <i>not</i> finite, it is elastic, and affected by many factors. Population
  growth creates jobs at the same time that it provides more people to fill jobs,
  and population decline decreases the number of jobs at the same time as it
  provides fewer people to work at them. Population growth creates jobs because
  people consume as well as produce: they buy things, they go to movies, they
  send their children to school, they build houses, they fill their cars with
  gasoline, they go to the dentist, they buy food at stores and restaurants. When
  the population declines, stores, schools, and hospitals close, and jobs are
  lost.

  <blockquote>
  [I]t is worth noting that the U.S. and European public always overestimate the
  size of the foreign-born population. Two-thirds of Americans give inaccurate
  responses to questions about the proportion of the population of foreign born,
  and about how racial and ethnic groups are distributed in the national
  population. When asked in 2006 what proportion of the U.S. population was born
  outside the United States, most people tended to choose a figure much higher
  than the Census Bureau figure of 12 percent. Only 34 percent selected the
  correct answer ("closer to 10 percent"); 25 percent said the number was "closer
  to 25 percent"; and 28 percent believed it exceeded 25 percent of the total
  population.
  </blockquote>
  These numbers don't include the undocumented migrants though! Aren't those the
  dangerous types? The ones we see as treacherous illegals whom we do not permit
  any other image than as dubious and immoral, and therefore, within the category
  we place them, must be so?

  published a 2017
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1078087417704974">paper</a>
  on the relation between sanctuary cities and crime, writing that:
  <blockquote>
  The idea that sanctuary policies drive up crime rates is premised to a large
  extent on the notion that undocumented immigrants tend to offend at higher
  rates, something that has been disproven time and again. In fact, many studies
  find an inverse relationship between immigration, undocumented or otherwise,
  and crime rates . . . Despite these findings . . . criminalization has been the
  default response of the federal government to the "problem" of undocumented
  immigration . . . Indeed, if anything, undocumented immigrants may be more
  likely to be victims of crime, rather than perpetrators of crime . . . Our
  findings suggest that sanctuary policies themselves do not affect crime rates,
  which contradicts the primary narrative for their repeal . . . Sanctuary cities
  were initially designed to provide aid to and then incorporate people into
  American life from war-torn Central American countries. The policies have a
  strong basis in empathy, often with the backing of churches and local aid
  organizations. Thus, the policies are designed to assist people in extremely
  vulnerable positions in the United States in navigating their way to a life
  that is as safe and healthy as possible. However, in recent years, a few
  high-profile incidents where undocumented immigrants have committed horrific
  crimes have led some political candidates—generally on the right—and other
  actors to make sweeping negative claims about the deleterious effects of
  sanctuary cities . . . We found these claims highly dubious on their face given
  evidence beginning in the 1930s and continuing until today that immigrant
  populations tend to produce less crime because these populations are more
  concerned with deportation and running afoul of the law relative to the
  native-born population.
  </blockquote>
  In this context, the researchers conducted their own analysis to evaluate these
  claims, finding that:
  <blockquote>
  [T]he difference between our sanctuary cities and nonsanctuary cities on the
  matching variables reduced to essentially zero. The result indicates that there
  is no discernible difference on each type of crime we measured between
  sanctuary and nonsanctuary cities. Thus, when it comes to crime, we conclude
  that sanctuary cities have essentially no impact one way or the other.

  out the example of one city in Texas right along the Mexico border:
  <blockquote>
  More than 80% of El Paso's residents are Hispanic and the vast majority of these
  individuals are of Mexican origin. A large population of El Paso's Hispanic
  population are immigrants. In fact, El Paso has one of the highest proportions
  of immigrants among U.S. cities. Many of these migrants are undocumented. If
  those who fear Mexican immigration are right, then El Paso should be a hotbed
  of violence. As it turns out, El Paso is one of the safest cities in the United
  States with a homicide rate of 2.4 per 100,000 residents.

  et al. lightly when they turned the joke around and
  <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/library/publications/comparing-crime-rates-between-undocumented-immigrants-legal-immigrants-and">claimed</a>
  in 2020:
  <blockquote>
  Contrary to public perception, we observe considerably lower felony arrest rates
  among undocumented immigrants compared to legal immigrants and native-born US
  citizens and find no evidence that undocumented criminality has increased in
  recent years . . . Our findings are also consistent with research on the
  selective nature of migration, which suggests that immigrants tend to fare
  better on multiple social indicators than would be expected by their level of
  socioeconomic disadvantages . . . In addition, many undocumented immigrants are
  driven by economic and educational opportunities for themselves and their
  families, and the decision to migrate necessarily requires a considerable
  amount of motivation and planning. As such, undocumented immigrants may be
  selected on qualities such as motivation to work and ambition to achieve,
  attributes that are unlikely to predispose them toward criminality.
  </blockquote>
  Light et al. used data between 2012 and 2018, but
  <a href="https://immigrationlab.org/our-team/ran-abramitzky/">Ran Abramitzky</a>
  et al. were surely not serious when they
  <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31440/w31440.pdf">expanded</a>
  the time range, studying incarceration data between 1850 and 2020! They don't
  distinguish between illegal and legal immigrants in their study, but they
  write:
  <blockquote>
  [W]e document that, as a group, immigrant men have had a lower incarceration
  rate than US-born men for the last 150 years of American history . . . Today,
  immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than all US-born men, and 30%
  less likely to be incarcerated relative to white US-born men.
  </blockquote>
  To the great feminists who feel neglected, the authors dutifully kept
  inclusivity in mind! They focused on men "because men constitute the vast
  majority of the incarcerated population both today and in the past", observing
  that, "Our takeaways are unchanged if we include women". Over such a long time
  period: is this joke in fact true? Even the conservative Cato joins the
  merriment! Much to our chagrin, it was only earlier this year that
  <a href="https://www.cato.org/people/alex-nowrasteh">Alex Nowrasteh</a>
  <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/illegal-immigrants-have-low-homicide-conviction-rate-setting-record-straight-illegal-immigrant">admitted</a>
  as much, specifically on homicide conviction rates. After jumping through a few
  hoops in data inconsistencies, lack of transparency, and confusion, he arrived
  at the same conclusion that the joke is on us! Yet, the researchers of the
  sanctuary city paper published a follow-up 2019 book, SANCTUARY CITIES, which
  expanded on the original paper with more research supporting the conclusions,
  in response to a misuse of the paper:
  <blockquote>
  Unbeknownst to them [the authors], conservative media outlets like Fox and
  others were using their research to justify banning sanctuary cities based on a
  misinterpretation of a figure they had included in the paper.
  </blockquote>
  As a matter of fact, criminal activity in general, not only from illegal
  immigrants, has been benting towards a certain direction for a number of years.
  Crime
  <a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend">data</a>
  from the FBI (because if the FBI doesn't come to you, you go to the FBI!) with
  incident rates back until 1985 shows a distinctly downward trend on all crimes
  nationally since 1992 that some with keen eyes may characterize as a consistent
  decline. Confirming the wisdom of these perceptive onlookers, a Pew study
  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/">combined</a>
  the crime data from the FBI and Bureau of Justice Statistics, each with a
  different data collection method, going so far to even describe the type of
  decline: "[D]ata show dramatic declines in U.S. violent and property crime
  rates since the early 1990s". And yet the Pew study points out that most
  Americans, 77% in 2023, up from 47% in 2000, believe that crime has risen
  nationally. Why this large discrepancy? Could it be that a particular party is
  spreading lies about the country's imminent ruin and disaster from caravans of
  dangerous, nameless, faceless criminals entering the country? The authors of
  SANCTUARY CITIES, after reviewing the media's portrayal of sanctuary cities,
  write in the book:
  <blockquote>
  This [crime] narrative is fed by a highly negative and stereotypical portrayal
  of immigrants by the media . . . [T]he media persistently frame immigrants as
  undocumented, imply criminality by drawing attention primarily to imigrant
  arrests and detention, and focus on the border . . . Given the scholarship
  reviewed . . . there is little doubt that this framing drives many Americans to
  conflate immigration with crime, and to think of the issue in highly episodic
  ways.
  </blockquote>
  The authors continue:
  <blockquote>
  The potential benefits of sanctuary policies in the city from increasing
  cooperation between immigrant communities and police has been more and more
  drowned out, particularly in broadcast media and television news, by
  politicians like Donald Trump who seek to use the issue for electoral advantage
  and to tap into the nativism and racism that still make fear-mongering so
  effective in the United States.
  </blockquote>
  Wherefore this fear-mongering if not horror and panic, terror and fright, nerves
  shaking in the night?

  Travel is useful, it exercises the imagination. All the rest is disappointment

  It's a novel, just a fictitious narrative. Littré says so, and he's never
  wrong.<br>
  <br>
  And besides, in the first place, anyone can do as much. You just have to close
  your eyes.<br>

  It's on the other side of life.

  It is most relevant here! to mention that Carl Jung writes in his large and
  unwieldy RED BOOK:
  <blockquote>
  At that time, in the fortieth year of my life, I had achieved everything that I
  had wished for myself. I had achieved honor, power, wealth, knowledge, and
  every human happiness. Then my desire for the increase of these trappings
  ceased, the desire ebbed from me and horror came over me. The vision of the
  flood seized me and I felt the spirit of the depths, but I did not understand
  him. Yet he drove me on with unbearable inner longing and I said: "My soul,
  where are you? Do you hear me? I speak, I call you—are you there? I have
  returned, I am here again. I have shaken the dust of all the lands from my
  feet, and I have come to you. I am with you. After long years of wandering, I
  have come to you again." . . . Life does not come from events, but from us.
  Everything that happens outside has already been.
  <br><br>
  <i>Therefore whoever considers the event from outside always sees only that it
  already was, and that it is always the same. But whoever looks from inside,
  knows that everything is new. The events that happen are always the same. But
  the creative depths of man are not always the same. Events signify nothing,
  they signify only in us. We create the meaning of events. The meaning is and
  always was artificial. We make it.</i>
  </blockquote>
  In the latter half of this quote, Jung touches on Nietzsche's eternal
  recurrence, having explicitly mentioned in a lecture at ETH Zurich in 1935 a
  turning point at a certain life phase as a parallel:
  <blockquote>
  A point exists at about the thirty-fifth year when things begin to change, it is
  the first moment of the shadow side of life, of the going down to death. It is
  clear that Dante found this point and those who have read <i>Zarathustra</i>
  will know that Nietzsche also discovered it.
  </blockquote>
  Yes! Having encountered that point many, many decades ago, I can personally
  attest to such a phenomenon. Specifically in THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, this may
  be what Jung was referring to, as this was exactly what announced for me
  (too!) the shadow side of life:
  <blockquote>
  When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his
  home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and his
  solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
  changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and
  spake thus unto it:
  <br>
  Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom
  thou shinest!
  </blockquote>
  Mein Zarathustra, for whom but thee doth I shine, and doth nicht exist mein
  happiness wert nicht for thee! Speak, mein Zarathustra! Teach mich der Über!
  Let no unscrupulous atheist tell his good fellow Christians that God did not
  rest on the seventh day, as the big book proclaims! But what did He do the day
  before? He doth maketh the beautiful animals! He doth granteth his own image in
  you! And me! He doth maketh among them Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and
  those pagans too, so that they may quibble away! What an important task! While
  they bickered away, there roameth in the background the many dinosaurs that
  were created on the same day! But what did Jung do on the sixth? We learn from
  within the covers of the red tome:
  <blockquote>
  Sixth night. My soul leads me into the desert, into the desert of my own self. I
  did not think that my soul is a desert, a barren, hot desert, dusty and without
  drink. The journey leads through hot sand, slowly wading without a visible goal
  to hope for? How eerie is this wasteland. It seems to me that the way leads so
  far away from mankind. I take my way step by step, and do not know how long my
  journey will last.
  </blockquote>
  Doth Jung's journey not sound like a great time? Some mighty fun? I say it is
  certainly so! But caught in Jung's desert, I spot in the yonder, through some
  rippling hot air, some shining blue puddles! Here, my dear reader, I find
  myself finally on familiar, recognizable grounds! It was in 1948 that the
  sociologist Oliver Cox published his book, CASTE, CLASS, RACE, just one year
  after my birth! If the appearance of the digits in that year strikes some
  readers with the unmoored, unrelatable distance of a past too long ago, those
  very digits evoke in me the immense fondness of attachment and nostalgia, like
  discovering an oasis after weeks of fruitless trekking in the desert. Aye! How
  the soul longs for the comforting airs of yesteryear! Although more popular
  back in my day, Cox's work and reputation have waned in the intervening years,
  compelling one to think it is high time someone resurrects if not the man
  himself then surely his words! Just as we do with ours, Cox called his era
  the "modern times" as he observes the flexible nature of prejudice:
  <blockquote>
  Probably one of the most persistent social illusions of modern times is that we
  have race prejudice against other people because they are physically
  different—that race prejudice is instinctive. From the point of view of
  Anglo-Saxon, gentile, well-to-do people, we may hate peoples of other
  nationalities, hate Jews, hate all colored peoples, and hate union workers. Yet
  we can safely say that these are not all an identical social attitude. Our
  feeling against, say, the Italians may vanish if they become our allies in war;
  feeling against the Jews may subside as we begin to discount the importance of
  religion in determining social phenomena; if Negroes do our work contentedly
  and help to break strikes for us, we may defend and even treat them amicably;
  we may see considerable virtue in union workers if they insist that the company
  union has more merit than the outside organization. Human beings have the
  capacity for "social hatred" or antagonism; yet in any given social situation
  of inter-group antagonism, we do not seek an explanation by referring to this
  capacity. The social antagonism is as stable and as different as the inciting
  cause—the interest—behind the antagonism. Human nature itself is probably the
  most plastic and malleable of all animal nature.
  </blockquote>
  Resulting from this malleability, Cox's central idea is that race prejudice is
  not separate from class exploitation but are outgrowths of capitalist
  interests:
  <blockquote>
  [The] reaction of labor, however, is not peculiarly a racial phenomenon; the
  conflict is essentially between employer and worker. Indeed, workers will react
  to inanimate objects, to machinery, in a characteristic way if that latter is
  introduced suddenly as a significant substitute for labor. Workers have been
  known to riot and attack machines in a way not unlike their attacks upon other
  workers who, because of lower standards, are favored by employers . . . It
  should be noted that this [racial] attitude is not an exploitative attitude; it
  is a conflict between two exploited groups generated by the desire of one group
  of workers to keep the value of its labor power by maintaining its scarcity. In
  Trinidad, British West Indies, Negro workers, in almost identical terms, fought
  against the continued introduction of indentured East Indian laborers; and
  between 1930 and 1932 Negroes on the South Side of Chicago demonstrated against
  the employment of white "foreigners" by certain public utilities . . . We may
  cite, of course, many illustrations of this attitude among whites in the United
  States—beginning, perhaps, with the early anti-Irish attitude in the East.
  Every conflict between strikers and "scabs" produces similar attitudes among
  the strikers . . . This apparent racial conflict, then, is in fact an extension
  of the modern political-class conflict. The employer needs labor, cheap labor;
  he finds this in Asiatic workers and displaces white, more expensive labor with
  them. White workers then react violently against the Asiatics, indeed, not
  unlike the way in which early handicraft workers reacted against the machine.
  On this point Eliot Grinnell Mears observes [in the book RESIDENT ORIENTALS ON
  THE AMERICAN PACIFIC COAST]: "The organized-labor attitude . . . while
  strenuously opposed in its public utterances to Oriental immigration, is
  actually interested in racial questions in so far [sic] as they affect
  competitive conditions in industry. . . . The issue is capital and labor, not
  race and labor."

  We now turn to the distinction between legal and illegal immigration. Legal
  immigrants are not the focus of this piece, and I shall mention them only by
  reference to the Migration Policy Institute, with groups sorted alphabetically
  by origin:

  As for illegal immigrants, Customs and Border Protection
  <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters">shares</a>
  data and visualizations on the number of known migrant entries. CBP seems to
  favor not discovering, finding, or locating, but encountering, giving their
  statistics the daring name of Nationwide Encounters, evoking the mystery and
  thrall of a movie name like Alien Encounter: First Contact. Although these are
  by no means first contacts, encountering for sure remains preferable to any
  from among confronting, engaging, tracking, and capturing. The visualization
  offers a convenient citizenship filter for those who wish to delineate migrants
  by origin, including of course South American countries but also the places one
  suspects are a wee bit further away, behind a pond or some mountains like
  China, Russia, India, Romania, Burma, Turkey, and the Philippines. Pew provided
  a few
  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/15/migrant-encounters-at-the-us-mexico-border-hit-a-record-high-at-the-end-of-2023/">visualizations</a>
  on the growing numbers of migrants on the southern border, the greater portion
  traveling in families, and the origin countries with the most migrants.

  Who are these migrants from the south? The approach to use is not to begin with
  outlook anticipating crime, drugs, immorality, and violence, and then to see
  whether what we encounter confirms or denies our criminal expectations, but to
  have an open eye towards what are people like any other, and it may be that
  crime plays only a small part of the whole story. Migrants come from various
  locations, but one difficult stretch for South Americans traveling north is the
  crossing into Central America, the Darién Gap. Last year, CNN
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOWthjWmS2s">covered</a>
  the story of this part of the migrant trail in five parts, providing first-hand
  footage of the people and journey. I think these are ordinary people making the
  perilous trek for better opportunity, quite separate from the disturbing
  narrative among conservatives of criminal hordes slipping into the homeland
  under the cover of night. In spite of this, I am against illegal immigration
  out of practical concern.

  <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/about/staff/kathleen-bush-joseph">Kathleen Bush-Joseph</a>
  provides informative information in a Migration Policy Institute
  <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/outmatched-us-asylum-system">report</a>
  on migrants, the asylum situation, the government's response, and the generally
  insufficient resources in funding and personnel to handle the rapid rise in
  migrant arrivals in the past few years. She writes:
  <blockquote>
  To improve border management, the United States needs a functioning asylum
  system so that people eligible for protection can receive it, and those who are
  ineligible can be quickly removed after fair review of their claim . . .
  Presently, the arrival of record numbers of asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico
  border, the outdated legal framework for adjudicating their claims, and
  resource allocations that do not prioritize adjudications mean that the asylum
  system faces unprecedented strain. Since border officials are unable to quickly
  remove most border arrivals, nearly 2.5 million were released into the country
  to await immigration court proceedings between January 2021 and March 2023 and
  had no confirmed departure . . . The immigration court process typically takes
  years; some 2023 arrivals to New York City have been scheduled for initial
  hearings in 2027 . . . By most measures, the U.S. asylum system does not meet
  its objectives. Those eligible for asylum do not receive it in a timely manner,
  and migrants deemed ineligible are not returned to their countries of origin.
  Increasing arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border continue to overwhelm enforcement
  and protection screening capacity, and asylum adjudications cannot keep up with
  new filings . . . A new era of global displacement is underway that includes
  major movements within the Western Hemisphere. Insufficient resources and
  litigation largely dictate policy on the ground, and the pressures on
  destination cities that are receiving tens of thousands of migrants for which
  they have not been prepared has shifted public opinion even among strongly
  pro-immigration elected leaders, who are calling for more effective border
  enforcement measures, reduced numbers of asylum seekers, and increased federal
  funding to support migrant services.
  </blockquote>
  Curiously enough, Bush-Joseph notes that:
  <blockquote>
  President Barack Obama inherited a better resourced immigration enforcement
  regime than his predecessors and focused on removing from the U.S. interior
  noncitizens who had been convicted of serious crimes and recent arrivals,
  earning the nickname "deporter in chief." His administration conducted a
  record number of removals, averaging 344,000 per year.

  in Brookings,
  <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/fixing-the-border-four-reasons-the-immigration-crisis-isnt-going-away/">poses</a>
  the migrant crisis as a surge management problem, calculating that the the
  number of border patrol staff has remained nearly constant between 2018 and
  2023, at just over 16,000, even as the number of migrants grew from hundreds of
  thousands to millions. Kamarck cites a Syracuse University TRAC
  <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/backlog/">dashboard</a>
  on the number of pending cases in the immigration backlog, which as of May 2024
  comes to just over 3.5 million. The solution Kamarck recommends is to close the
  border temporarily:
  <blockquote>
  There are many people out there with legitimate claims to be in the United
  States. Their cases should be settled, and those who don't qualify should be
  sent home. Biden should close down the border temporarily so that those who are
  already here can be fairly evaluated. Some will meet the criteria and many more
  will be sent home.
  </blockquote>

  Pew
  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/08/republicans-and-democrats-have-different-top-priorities-for-u-s-immigration-policy/">finds</a>
  that Republicans favor deporting illegal migrants and securing the southern
  border, and Democrats prefer giving migrants a legal pathway to staying in the
  country. However the immigration judges decide each case, they reach a
  conclusion on whether a migrant can stay, but the current situation for
  millions of migrants is a lengthy limbo of waiting for a court to consider
  their case—the migrant crisis itself presents a problem of scale along with the
  lack of adequate resources. On top of the massive backlog, an additional issue
  surfaces. Of the migrants already in the country, what is the cost of keeping
  them here while they wait several years on the backlog? It is worth the
  reminder here that resources do not manifest from thin air, and government
  spending comes from either taxpayers or taking on debt. Let us consider a view
  on finances, and then I will put forth my view on the matter, but let me begin
  by saying that I agree with the statement that everyone deserves adequate
  access to resources, opportunities—I am not against this, but how do we convert
  this ideal into reality?

  It costs resources to process this influx of migrants, but we shall see that the
  costs mount further when the government subsidizes their housing while they
  wait for an asylum hearing. But first we must reflect on the state of the
  government's finances—it is no exaggeration that the federal debt is rapidly
  becoming a serious problem. Federal debt held by the public has been rising
  rapidly, according to
  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1jhVT">data</a>
  from the Federal Reserve; as a percent of GDP, it stood at 36.8% in Q1 2000 but
  has risen to 96.4% in Q4 2023 (all percentages mentioned below in this topic
  are in proportion to the GDP; this measure indicates the country's ability to
  pay its debt). In particular, this debt increase means that the interest the
  government pays is also rising. The Congressional Budget Office
  <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727">showed</a>
  that in fiscal year 2023, the net interest was 2.4%, about half of the cost of
  Social Security, the largest government expenditure, which came in at 5%. The
  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget
  <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/2023-interest-costs-reach-659-billion">declared</a>
  last year, "Interest is now the <i>fourth-largest government program</i>, behind
  only Social Security, Medicare, and defense." CBO in 2020
  <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56910">projected</a>
  that by 2050, net interest would grow to 8%, and earlier this year
  <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60127">provided</a>
  a broader budget projection over the next thirty years; in this new projection,
  net interest grows to 6.3% in 2054, overtaking Social Security's 5.9%. CBO
  warns about the rising debt:
  <blockquote>
  From 2024 to 2054, growing deficits would push federal debt held by the public
  far beyond any previously recorded level . . . Such large and growing debt
  would have significant economic and financial consequences. Among its other
  effects, it would slow economic growth, drive up interest payments to foreign
  holders of U.S. debt, heighten the risk of a fiscal crisis, increase the
  likelihood of other adverse outcomes, and make the nation's fiscal position
  more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates.
  </blockquote>
  This projection is predicated on "the assumption that current laws governing
  taxes and spending will generally remain unchanged"—this is the default course
  if the country remains on its current track.

  options for reducing the deficit, considering many areas of reducing spending
  and raising revenue. And how high can the country's debt go? According an
  ominous
  <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2023/10/6/when-does-federal-debt-reach-unsustainable-levels">article</a>
  last year from the Penn Wharton Budget Model:
  <blockquote>
  We estimate that the U.S. debt held by the public cannot exceed about 200
  percent of GDP even under today's generally favorable market conditions . . .
  Under current policy, the United States has about 20 years for corrective
  action after which no amount of future tax increases or spending cuts could
  avoid the government defaulting on its debt whether explicitly or implicitly.
  </blockquote>
  Some perspective is needed: this is only one model's estimate, and we should not
  easily succumb to fatalist portents.

  With an eye towards this growing debt, a Senate
  <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/hearings/the-rich-get-richer-deficits-get-bigger-how-tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy-and-corporations-drive-the-national-debt-">hearing</a>
  was held last year with the admittedly provocative title from the Democrats in
  the majority, THE RICH GET RICHER, DEFICITS GET BIGGER: HOW TAX CUTS FOR THE
  WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS DRIVE THE NATIONAL DEBT. The slate of witnesses
  provide a fair overview of liberal, conservative, and non-partisan stances,
  predicated on statistics, modeling, projections, and various outcomes of past
  policies. I'm not going to comment on their testimonies because I have nothing
  further to add, but a very brief summary of the issue is this:

  <pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
  balance = revenue - spending
  </pre>

  Because spending is greater than revenue, the budget balance is in deficit. This
  fact is not contentious, and that it is a growing problem is perhaps one of the
  few points of agreement between the parties. However, Democrats wish to remedy
  this with higher taxes on the wealthy to bolster revenue, while Republicans
  want to curtail spending through fewer programs and a smaller government. The
  writer himself is partial to the Democrat view, but agrees that spending must
  also decline.

  The writer must mention a most enlightening moment in the hearing! Senator John
  Kennedy, a Republican, first confirming that one of the witnesses, Bruce
  Bartlett, was attending the hearing on the side of Democrats, commences
  (at 1:42:39) his approach which runs at all odds against every other senator's
  reliance on decent sense, contrary to everyone else's facts and figures, rhyme
  and reason: he divines his victim's convictions through the victim's old
  tweets. Senator Kennedy, we see, adheres to the motto: "By thy tweets shall ye
  be known!" He proceeds to read out a series of Bartlett's openly political
  tweets, and after reciting each tweet with a barely conceiled contempt, he
  looks up at Bartlett with an innocent disbelief, asking if he read the tweet
  correctly. And once Senator Kennedy finishes going through the tweets, he
  calmly concludes his inquiry with a sharp retort: "Mr. Bartlett, I appreciate
  you answering my questions. It helps me to determine the credence or
  credibility to give to your testimony." Though the writer doesn't think Senator
  Kennedy's approach yields much in the way of clarity, the writer admits he
  likes the senator's style. Of course, later, Senator Tim Kaine sets right the
  context of some of the tweets.

  We were discussing the cost of this wave of migrants. With the federal debt
  growing at the current rate, I am rather against the government recklessly
  expanding its spending. USAFacts
  <a href="https://usafacts.org/state-of-the-union/immigration/">calculated</a>
  that, "The government spent $22.4 billion . . . on immigration and border
  security last year [fiscal year 2023]." This would be 0.08% of GDP, a fairly
  low number, but considering the current trajectory, when the government should
  aim to reduce spending, it would be a mistake to let spending run loose. Since
  we have lingered on the debt issue for longer than the writer intended, we
  shall consider only briefly the issue of state and local debt, because states
  and cities are also in debt, though not as drastically as the federal
  government. In particular, we shall consider the debt-y New York: the state
  comptroller
  <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/reports/finance/2023-fcr/debt">projects</a>
  rising state debt, as
  <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/Annual-Report-on-Capital-Debt-and-Obligations-Fiscal-Year-2024-FINAL_Revised-_3_26_2024.pdf">does</a>
  the city comptroller for the city. It is rather interesting to note that the
  state limits its self-justifying vanity to a single bold heading, "New York
  State Ranks Second Highest in Outstanding Debt Nationwide", while the city's
  report dedicated an entire section to note that despite a high debt burden, the
  city's debt, when viewed in context, compares favorably to those of other large
  cities which it calls the "Peer Group". This is the rough breakdown of the
  city's debt, as of June 30, 2023, in billions of dollars:

  <pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
  Gross Debt Outstanding                         $98
  New York Water Finance Authority (NYW)         $32.2
  Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)    $49.1
  Health and Hospitals (H+H)                     $ 0.48

  Total                                         $179.8
  </pre>

  But in its official accounting, the city does not regard this total as its debt
  load. Only the first line item is relevant to the city's official debt number,
  or what the city calls "indebtedness", which is then measured against the
  city's debt limit; the three other entities issue their own debt and are
  separate from the gross debt. Further, not all of the $98 billion counts
  towards the debt limit, as some costs are excluded from the city's definition
  of indebtedness; the total indebtedness at the end of FY 2023 was computed to
  be $96.9 billion (though this number is brought down further in the accounting
  through an exemption called the Transitional Finance Authority).

  In light of this debt, what is the cost of supporting asylum seekers in the
  city? We now trace the city's resource burden to support migrants. The city
  comptroller shares a
  <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/services/for-the-public/accounting-for-asylum-seeker-services/asylum-seeker-census/">census</a>
  for the asylum seekers in city-funded shelters, writing that, "As of March 10,
  2024, the City had approximately 64,600 people seeking asylum in City funded
  shelter". As Mayor Eric Adams
  <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/583-23/as-city-nears-arrival-100-000-asylum-seekers-since-last-spring-mayor-adams-lays-out-updated#/0">said</a>
  last summer, "Our compassion may be limitless, but our resources are not." At
  the time, an updated budgetary forecast showed that the cost of supporting
  asylum seekers "is projected to cost our city $12 billion over the course of
  three fiscal years without policy changes and further support from the state
  and federal governments." I think it is easy to ask for money from elsewhere,
  but the state and the federal government are also both in debt. In December,
  the city comptroller released a
  <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Funding-for-New-York-Citys-Services-for-People-Seeking-Asylum.pdf">report</a>
  on the cost of funding asylum seekers: $4.7 billion in FY 2024 and $6.1 billion
  in FY 2025. To be sure, it is true that this funding may be viewed as the
  initial cost of investment to expand a labor force that will generate
  additional tax revenue over time. But how much do they generate? The
  comptroller's office released a fact
  <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/facts-not-fear-how-welcoming-immigrants-benefits-new-york-city/">list</a>
  about immigration's benefits to the city, which I do not have an issue with.
  However, again, we must be careful not to conflate legal and illegal
  immigrants. We are here considering specifically illegal immigrants, and, in
  particular, the asylum seekers the city is funding. The fact list cites
  an American Immigration Council
  <a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/new-york/">infographic</a>
  on the tax contributions from immigrants in 2021, in which, again, we should not
  be misled by the high revenue and spending power of immigrants in general, but
  only of illegal immigrants. The infographic doesn't isolate asylum seekers, and
  the closest approximation we have is in the "undocumented immigrants" section,
  which shows that they contributed $3 billion in total revenue: $1.8B for
  federal and $1.2B for state and local. Assuming the best case, that these
  contributions are entirely from asylum seekers, the city receives a only
  portion of the $1.2B, which, when measured against the projected FY 2024 and FY
  2025 costs to fund asylum seekers, nets in a loss. It may be contested that
  these are ongoing contributions as opposed to the one-time cost of funding, and
  that the contributions accumulated over several years may flip the net into a
  gain: true, but the funding should be compared to the opportunity cost of not
  paying down the existing debt, which will lower interest payments over time. As
  we saw in the city's debt composition above, who knew that water could be so
  expensive? Or that maintaining and running subways and keeping them from
  falling into disrepair could come at such a massive deficit? The state
  comptroller laments in a
  <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/osdc/pdf/report-3-2025.pdf">report</a>
  on the MTA's debt:
  <blockquote>
  Budgeted debt service . . .  is projected to reach nearly $5 billion by 2031,
  which is 83 percent ($2.3 billion) more than in 2023 . . . Continued
  backloading of debt to achieve short-term savings . . . will also result in
  higher costs to the MTA's riders, toll payers and taxpayers in the long-term.
  If the MTA has to issue more debt for investments in the system amid potential
  funding gaps from its funding partners, then this unadvisable, costly practice
  is likely not only to continue, but potentially grow as it attempts to manage
  the operating budget impact.
  </blockquote>
  The city released a
  <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/budget/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2024/03/MTA.pdf">report</a>
  on the MTA's budget, and in Figure 3, we see that debt service, at $2.8 billion,
  costs more than running the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad
  (yes, the two railroads are not spelled the same way).

  In reasoning from the infographic above, we have assumed that asylum seekers
  have legal authorization to work, but what warrants this assumption? According
  to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, to even
  <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/asylum">apply</a>
  for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), an asylum seeker must first
  apply for asylum and then wait 180 days. On paper, this is how long it will
  take, but as of May 2024, the city's immigration
  <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/asylumbl/">backlog</a>,
  according to Syracuse University's TRAC, sits at about 150,000.
  <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/theresa-cardinal-brown/">Theresa Cardinal Brown</a>
  agrees that the asylum system is broken on a 60 MINUTES
  <a href="https://youtu.be/PwuMaKSrxiY?t=318">episode</a>,
  saying, "We just don't have the personnel, the resources, the infrastructure, or
  the right processes to manage what's happening there well." With large numbers
  of asylum seekers, Brown reiterates what we saw earlier at the federal level,
  that it may take years of waiting on the backlog; Brown says, "On average,
  people [asylum seekers] . . . might wait three to five years" to get an asylum
  hearing, and that "It could be four years, four and a half years, before you
  [an asylum seeker] can ask for work authorization." As shown in the episode,
  many migrants have come to work and earn their keep, but the current laws
  simply don't permit them to do so without protracted waiting. Proposals have
  been suggested to reduce the wait time. Last year, Senator Susan Collins
  (a Republican)
  <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/255/text">introduced</a>
  the Asylum Seeker Work Authorization Act of 2023 to the Senate, which, the
  National Immigration Forum
  <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/article/asylum-seeker-work-authorization-act-of-2023-bill-summary/">describes</a>
  as reducing the wait period of 180 days to 30 for asylum seekers who entered the
  country through an official port of entry. Similarly, according to the
  Immigration Forum article, Representative Chellie Pingree (a Democrat)
  <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1325/text">proposed</a>
  to the House a bill with the same reduction, only without the port of entry
  qualification. Neither of these proposals has been passed yet, but even if
  either does and the wait period were shortened, we must not forget the backlog
  and the preliminary wait time of "three to five years" that Brown estimated to
  reach an asylum hearing. Last September, Mayor Eric Adams made an
  <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/660-23/mayor-adams-expedited-sprint-identify-asylum-seekers-eligible-apply-work-permits">effort</a>
  to hasten this first step by opening a help center to aid asylum seekers to
  prepare and send in applications for asylum, yet even with this assistance,
  "[T]he city expects the number of people currently eligible to apply for work
  authorization to be a relatively small percentage of those now in care." In
  spite of Adam's attempt at a remedy, one may be forgiven in finding fault with
  the city's approach that, in the face of this problem, Adams insists, "New
  York City needs significant and timely support from our state and federal
  partners to tackle this national issue"—as though asking someone else for help
  should be the city's default solution rather than a self-determined,
  self-prescribed, self-sufficient path to financial sustainability, because,
  after all, this has become the city's problem, and looking elsewhere for
  charity resembles irresponsible complaining.

  One month after setting up the aslyum assistance center, Adams' administration,
  perhaps with an newfound eye towards fiscal responsibility,
  eventually "announced that it would implement a new policy limiting shelter
  stays for newly arrived families with children to 60 days",
  <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/report-on-the-investigation-of-the-implementation-of-the-60-day-rule-for-asylum-seeker-families/">according</a>
  to the city comptroller. But the comptroller's report itself is a critical
  investigation of the new policy, complains that it is "haphazard", and
  recommends that the city should end it. For some reason the comptroller is more
  sympathetic to migrants who, by no fault of their own, are unauthorized to work
  and contribute than to the city's fiscal health. Contrast the current situation
  with that of the Italian immigrants during the city's tenement days around the
  early 1900s, who, as the Library of Congress
  <a href="https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/italian/tenements-and-toil/">records</a>,
  were able to work, though struggling, but the current laws prohibit this new
  wave of migrants from doing the same. We must remember: Opportunities do not
  grow on trees, money doesn't fall from the sky, and funding for asylum seekers
  comes from either tax revenue or incurring more debt—which adds to the current
  burden and diminishes the city's resources for everyone else—while this cost
  simultaneously does not entail a corresponding prospect for a positive return.

  Without a foreseeable path to quickly enable large portions of migrants to work
  and finance their own housing, under the current surge in migrants and the
  present laws preventing them from working, I am quite against accepting more
  migrants from entering the city and, by extention, states like Texas that are
  <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/texas-transports-over-100000-migrants-to-sanctuary-cities">busing</a>
  them across the country. My contention on illegal immigration is not about race,
  culture, religion, or crime, but an inadequate and incapable asylum system
  entrenched in a wave of divided politics, amplified by the confluence of
  polarized news, massive economic inequality, elite overproduction, and popular
  immiseration, situated against a backdrop of growing government debt. For legal
  immigrants who have a pathway to employment, promising and authorized, and who
  can contribute to the economy, I say: "Come one, come all! Come help us pay our
  debts!" To everyone else, I'm afraid the country at this time has its own
  problems and cannot handle the expense to subsidize everyone's well-being.

  For those liberals among us who still habor visionary longings for a utopic
  fantasy, perhaps the better course of action is to stop generating so much
  grating noise in public and complain about the mistreatment of migrants and
  expect some magical intervention to drop from the sky but to put our money
  where our mouth is and take it upon ourselves to financially support one or two
  (maybe three! or why not four?) migrants from our own hard-earned paycheck! To
  thee I say: you live up to your proclaimed beliefs, and Uncle Sam (and his
  wallet) thanks you for your services to your country! And to thee someone else
  has said,
  <blockquote>
  In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the
  role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from
  this responsibility—I welcome it . . . And so, my fellow Americans: ask not
  what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.
  </blockquote>

  Had Emma Lazarus lived in our age and were commissioned to write the
  generation-defining poem for the migrants of the world arriving along the great
  southern border, perhaps she would have called it, THE NEW WALL:

  <br>

  Not like the golden country of opportunity,<br>
  With dollar mountains from sea to shining sea;<br>
  Here at our desert-beaten, sunset gates shall stand<br>
  A mighty barricade with steel grates, whose metal<br>
  Is a soaring thirty feet, and its name<br>
  Wall For The Exiled. From the sun's heat too hot to touch<br>
  Glows a country with its own problems; its mild eyes renounced<br>
  The campus protests that twin parties frame.<br>
  <br>
  "Keep, travel's momentum, elsewhere welcomes!" bellows the steel<br>
  With silent grates. "We can't help, our tired, our poor,<br>
  Our huddled tribes yearning for a better shore,<br>
  The wretched sums of our teeming debt.<br>
  Send these, mercy from populists,<br>
  I lift my interest rates beside some outdated laws!"

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  Although the next country is close enough<br>
  that they can hear their roosters crowing and dogs barking,<br>
  they are content never to visit each other<br>
  all of the days of their lives.

<u id="race-gender-class">Race and Gender as Secondary to Class, and the Material View</u><br>

  I will in this section argue that race and gender inequalities are not, on their
  own, the essential sources of conflict, but are surface distinctions which
  serve as groupings for an underlying disparity: race and gender are instances
  of a more fundamental concern. I contend that race and gender are often
  mistakenly conflated with the principle unit of inequality, that race and
  gender are merely secondary concerns, and that preoccupations with them blind
  researchers and the general public to the core differentiator—the essential
  tension is class, and the primary conflict derives from class disparity. Class
  advantages confer power, resources, opportunities, privilege, representation,
  leverage over law and politics, deference, and cultural reproduction. Indeed,
  if class inequalities are reversed in favor of the historically oppressed, in
  favor of the marginalized races and the disadvantaged gender, the current
  discontent among these groups will cease, for it is neither race nor gender in
  themselves that are the crucial factors in this struggle, but power and
  privilege, which are direct products of class. This primacy of class and its
  distinction from race and gender are crucial: by embracing class as the
  principal unity of analysis, we can recognize the importance of the
  conventional approach to the problem of diversity and inequality: the material
  view, which is does not accentuate divides between groups by race or gender.

  We first consider race. The material view stands in contrast to the approach of
  race theorists who propagate divisive agendas by recoursing to ethnic pride,
  cultural relativism, and essentialist views on race as intractable
  constructs.
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9YCmdZAAAAAJ&hl=en">Philomena Essed</a>,
  in her 1991 book, UNDERSTANDING EVERYDAY RACISM, uses the example of Rosa N., an
  ethnically Surinamese medical doctor in the Netherlands:
  <blockquote>
  The accounts of Rosa N. cannot be seen as unreflective. We shall see that her
  evaluations are underpinned by years of deliberate questioning of her life in
  the Netherlands and searching for more information about the Dutch and about
  racism. Moreover Rosa N. has had many opportunities to systematically test her
  real experiences against her beliefs about racism. In addition, being a solo
  Black working in an all-White environment, she has had to strategize and assess
  possible risks attached to specific reactions to racism.
  </blockquote>
  I do not question Essed's study or analysis in the Netherlands where she was
  researching at the time and in her comparison with the United States, but her
  recommended solution is, I find, tenuous, incomplete, and disproportionate:
  <blockquote>
  Once we recognize the fact that racism is systematically integrated into
  meanings and routine practices by which social relations are reproduced, it
  follows that it is not specific agents but the very fabric of the social system
  that must be problematized. This requires that we reformulate the problem of
  racism as an everyday problem . . . These cannot be countered by fragmented
  policies. One cannot pursue pluralism without addressing the hidden presumption
  that the dominant culture is superior and need not be receptive to
  change . . . [T]he elements in a program to increase a critical understanding
  of race and ethnic relations . . . [require] that hidden implications of the
  ideal of cultural tolerance are countered, that the mechanisms of cultural
  racism are exposed, and that the overall denial of racism is resisted by
  massive dissemination of oppositional views through the media and in the
  education system.
  </blockquote>
  In the current affairs, several decades after Essed published her views, social
  discourse has evidently turned in her direction, and general awareness of
  racial issues has become prevalent—I do not doubt that this is a step towards
  progress on racial inequality, but, at the same time, I find that what Essed
  advances, the simple fact of consciousness of pervasive and systemic racism, is
  inadequate to compel the corresponding corrective action, and mere
  consciousness breeds false initiatives, virtue signaling, vague ideals, and
  rampant misunderstanding. Cognition of race matters is insufficient to address
  the patent material inequality, and relying on perspectival shifts to explain
  such inequality only misleads the public to justify disadvantaged communities
  rather than take measures to remedy the disparities. Essed elaborates on her
  race-based framing of cultural divides:
  <blockquote>
  Hidden under the surface of diversity, there is a strong tendency among Whites,
  in the United States as well as in the Netherlands, to assume the superiority of
  Euro-American values. Hidden also is the expectation that, in due time, Blacks
  must accept that the norms and values of the Euro-American tradition are
  superior and that adaptation is the only way to progress in society . . . The
  ideal and practice whereby interests and perspectives of the White group are
  used as the norm is an enduring and inescapable feature of the experiences of
  Blacks. Eurocentrism is interwoven in social relationships, in the language, in
  habits of thinking, in institutional relationships, and more generally in the
  conditions under which individuals or groups gain access to resources.
  Eurocentricism is so much ingrained in the social cognitions of the dominant
  group that Whites are often incapable of understanding the world from the point
  of view of Blacks.
  </blockquote>
  How far is Essed, along with other race theorists, willing to defend her views?
  Is economic prosperity specifically Eurocentric? Are Blacks and racial
  minorities, who have their differing norms and values, apathetic to material
  progress? Again, I do not question the premise that different cultures have
  their own value systems and perspectives, but it is foolish to take this
  relativism to an extreme and propose that it is the characteristic ethos of a
  certain culture and its people to refuse comforts, to uniformly deny
  self-interest, to spurn advancement.

  Additionally, it is incredibly short-sighted to proclaim the demise of
  Eurocentrism in favor of the prominence of an alternative, whether Black or
  otherwise. Let us appreciate the difficulty of detaching from Eurocentric
  systems: the persistence of the Latin language in binomial nomenclature to name
  the species of the natural world and also the Greek letters in mathematical
  notation. The modern writing systems in countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and
  the Phillipines are based on the Latin script, and consider, even more
  drastically, the wholesale adoption of Spanish in Central and South America and
  Portuguese in Brazil. It is likely more distressing and inconvenient, if not
  impossible, to return to what may be considered pre-European influence on
  culture and language. Indeed, it is quite a curious task to imagine how far a
  particularly courageous one could go were this daring spirit to attempt to
  cease employing the very language one finds oneself and most of one's country
  using, or even the language one is currently reading. And while it may appear
  to the naked eye that the internet supports the full panoply of languages, were
  one to uproot the predominant encoding known by the mystical name, UTF-8, one
  may notice that the English alphabet, against all others, fits so neatly into
  the soil that its letters take up the smallest footprint in this age of
  environmental crises.

  This is all very well, but we suggest the material view's solution: why should
  these belong to one group and not also everyone else? Consider England's
  history: a sixth-century villager in remote and pastoral East Sussex, in
  defiance of the recently arrived Anglo-Saxons and their newcomers' language of
  Old English, holding on tenderly to the treasured language of his forebears,
  Common Brittonic, did not suspect what later would become the language of the
  land. How silly it is to suppose that English does not belong to the
  descendants of the villager because the villager himself was simply stubborn.
  Nor did, having established themselves in the land, the progeny of the
  country's new residents, the Anglo-Saxon villagers of Suffolk in the eleventh
  century who resisted the sudden Norman French incursion and their foreign
  language—

  <blockquote>
  This year King William [the Conqueror, who two years earlier successfully
  invaded England and was crowned king] gave Earl Robert the earldom over
  Northumberland; but the landsmen attacked him in the town of Durham, and slew
  him, and nine hundred men with him. Soon afterwards Edgar Etheling came with
  all the Northumbrians to York; and the townsmen made a treaty with him: but
  King William came from the South unawares on them with a large army, and put
  them to flight, and slew on the spot those who could not escape; which were
  many hundred men; and plundered the town.
  </blockquote>
  <span class="quoter">
  —ANGLO-SAXON CHRONICLE, entry dated A.D. 1068, tr. J. Ingram and J.A. Giles
  </span>

  —suspect that these intruders would later morph their native tongue. To whom
  does the English language belong? This latest invading group, or the
  Anglo-Saxons before them, or the Britons before them—where does this end and
  the roots stop moving? It is true in a sense that each group adopts new
  changes to the language and makes it theirs, but why should we limit our
  understanding and stop at such lock-step and intermittent language-group
  pairing and not reflect on the broader picture, that culture and groups are a
  mutually informed, and both are continually evolving and accumulating upon
  precedents? Each successive group molds language and cultural artifacts to
  their needs and preferences, and, through the union of their changes to the
  given formulation, acquires ownership of all the prior forms.

  The difficulty of separating from the Eurocentric is echoed in an essay
  collection published last year, DECOLONIZING THE ENGLISH LITERARY CURRICULUM,
  edited by
  <a href="https://english.stanford.edu/people/ato-quayson">Ato Quayson</a>
  and
  <a href="https://www.english.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-ankhi-mukherjee">Ankhi Mukherjee</a>,
  Although the express intent of the editors and the contributors was to consider
  approaches to, as indicated in the book's title, decolonize the English
  literary curriculum, one should not be misjudged for noticing a persistent
  recognition at the task's difficulty. The editors write in the introduction:
  <blockquote>
  In departments of English, where we teach the history of literature and language
  from Anglo-Saxon to World Literature, chronology is Eurochronology to a large
  extent, and to situate oneself in literary tradition is to inhabit structures
  that are historically Eurocentric, patriarchal, classist, xenophobic, or
  racist. We can, where relevant, read literature as a textual as well as
  territorial inscription and remain vigilant of its implication in a given
  culture's criteria and contestation of value. Decolonizing the English literary
  curriculum would also entail a concerted effort to retrieve forgotten and
  discredited literary forms and figures, proletariat and women's voices.

  Here, we must ask of this phrase—"structures that are historically Eurocentric,
  patriarchal, classist, xenophobic, or racist"—whether it would not remain true
  were we to subtitute Eurocentric with any among: Middle East-centric,
  Afro-centric, or Asia-centric.

  Related to all this centrism, I wish to briefly delineate the difference between
  materialism and a recent trend in the humanities called new materialism, which
  deplores the human-centric worldview and promotes the agency in all living and
  inanimate matter: I do not question new materialism's central premise that
  humans play an almost insignificant part in the universe's scheme, but we
  should be careful not to take philosophical musings to an extreme and believe
  human societies, political orders, social relations, and economic systems
  should prioritize nature over humanity. Our relation to the world, our
  knowledge of it, our actions within its scope, cannot but be anthropocentric,
  and it is only within the limitation of this human-based framework that we can
  operate. It is naive to pretend, in the new materialist manner, that what we
  humans call "agency" can be ascribed to rocks, air, mountains—what does
  inanimate matter care for human finitude and follies? What need is there shift
  the central subject away from us and towards the eternal world? It is
  impossible overstate the prominence of the great many non-human organisms and
  inanimate matter, which have existed before us and will persist long after
  we're gone—we are not qualified to make assertions on whether nature is passive
  or whether it is a receptacle of our actions or whether it is has agency on the
  cosmic stage; inasfar as nature appears to be so, it is because of our limited
  vantage and our interests in nature, not because of nature in itself, which we
  cannot comprehend in its entirety. Does a tadpole make such preposterous claims
  about the coral reef? What could a single leaf, splayed in dull sedation,
  knowing only how to take in air and sunlight, see of itself in the raging
  rivers, the torrential rain, and the immense forest with its deep roots and the
  hordes of predator and prey?

  New materialists seem confused in their priorities and out of touch with the
  pressures of reality; we are concerned about global warming and its devastating
  effects on nature because the natural world is the premise of our habitat and
  the site of our resources, and our interests are bound up with harms to the
  environment. We are not intrinsically concerned with factors we do not know and
  which have little effect on us. Do we indeed care about the multitudes of
  landslides and avalanches and floods happening all the time in remote regions,
  all the violent local quakes and slow seismic movements which neither enter our
  awareness nor directly affect our interests, and then do we place greater value
  in such forces than in our own economies? Even if, as new materialists claim,
  the traditional divide between humans and the myriad non-human phenomena is a
  false dichotomy, since humans are a part of the natural ecosystem, it is a
  gross posturing of an inflated ego to state that we care for all natural things
  as though we are not mortal and our time and attention are not finite, as
  though we don't assign comparative value to the objects in the phenomenal
  world, as though we are guardians of this majestic universe in which we have
  somehow been given stewardship over its treasures when we are just a passing
  trickle of rain in a vast constellation completely heedless to our puddles and
  droplets. One significant difference between materialists and new materialists,
  then, is that materialists can make peace with knowing when they do not know.
  If new materialists are convinced of the certainties of such non-human animism,
  why do they not take up their word and renounce human society altogether and
  live the ascetic life in the mountains where they are completely free to
  commune with nature? Why all this noise and human self-interest from folks who
  quite readily denounce the centrality of human affairs?

  We return to the difficulty of the task of decolonizing the English curriculum
  in the Quayson and Mukherjee text.
  <a href="https://engl.uic.edu/profiles/mufti-nasser/">Nasser Mufti</a>
  writes in the chapter, VICTORIAN STUDIES AND DECOLONIZATION:
  <blockquote>
  [N]ot only were the leaders of decolonization bourgeois intellectuals trained in
  the Western academy, but they were also complete Anglophiles and
  Francophiles . . . [T]he leaders and intellectuals of anticolonial thought in
  the British colonial world never had a problem with Victorianism. They freely
  utilized, quoted, and valorized the White, conservative patriatchs of
  nineteenth-century British literature and culture. From the perspective of
  W.E.B. Du Bois, B.R. Ambedkar, and C.L.R. James, "decolonizing" the Victorian
  canon would be absurd, as it is this very canon—formed with and alongside
  colonization—that they loved <i>and relied on</i> to theorize the project of
  decolonization. They might tirelessly work for the liberation of the colonial
  world, but they do so oftentimes by way of the writings of Victorians like
  Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens, and Alfred Tennyson. From this perspective, it
  becomes possible to adapt Spivak's maxim: it should not be possible to research
  Victorian studies without remembering that Victorianism was integral to
  decolonization.
  </blockquote>
  Mufti even makes a scholarly quip at the dubious decolonizing task:
  <blockquote>
  The wholesale institutional embrace of "decolonize" should give one pause. As I
  am sure many chapters in this book note, and as has been noted by others, it
  would be a gross misunderstanding to mistake the verb "decolonize" for the
  noun "decolonization." The verb is new and emerges out of a middle-class
  encounter with the complicity between culture and imperialism. This is why it
  is seemingly possible to "decolonize" everything. The noun, however, is much
  older, has a closer relationship to the "postcolonial," and primarily describes
  anticolonial nationalism and Third Worldist self-determination of the
  mid-century . . . To put it perhaps too starkly: while decolonization "reeks of
  red-hot cannonballs and bloody knives," "decolonize" reeks of stale conference
  hotels and online workshops organized by Dean's initiatives.
  </blockquote>
  <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/centre-for-the-advancement-of-scholarship/article/1929450/prof-james-ogude">James Ogude</a>,
  in another chapter, #RHODESMUSTFALL AND THE REFORM OF THE LITERATURE CURRICULUM,
  reflects on another aspect of the difficulty at the task:
  <blockquote>
  On the one hand, we have a traditional cohort of students, who are predominantly
  White, but who also include a section of the Black elite for whom English
  without Shakespeare and the Great Tradition is incomplete—they push back at any
  attempts to bring about curriculum transformation. On the other hand, we have a
  cohort of Black students who are insisting on asserting a new identity through
  the literatures they read and are demanding change now . . . The push-and-pull
  situation has proved to be counterproductive for genuine curriculum reform, as
  curriculum creators strive to please these competing constituencies. The end
  result is what can hardly be described as a decolonized English curriculum, but
  the result of competing interests ranging from the interests of those senior
  faculty who are not prepared to let go of their old practices, and a new but
  energetic cohort of scholars who are seeking change but remain at the mercy of
  the senior scholars who see transformation as a threat to their own
  careers . . . We have to understand decoloniality as a process and perhaps a
  much more protracted one when it comes to curriculum change in a discipline
  such as English with so many competing interests. If one wants to see glimmers
  of change and challenges to the English literature syllabus, then one has to
  look elsewhere—far from the mainstream sites of scholarship and the academy.
  </blockquote>
  If this is true, where shall one look? The historical record suggests that one
  need not scour all the obscure corners of the world for some rarefied bounty
  because the resolution is already before our eyes: the manifest material
  changes that alter each generation in the body of the population and its
  regenerated perspective on the new state of the country, as a blending of the
  old and the new. If the successive series of newcomers to England could
  influence the language, if the modern English people consider the English
  language to be their own, all the intrusive changes from their ancestors be
  damned, and if the English have conferred the language on much of the world,
  how could it be that the language should not belong to those who speak it and
  who—who would dare to suggest?—will continue the long march of a language's
  evolution which reflects the populations that use it?

  [W]hat distinguishes Irish civilization for [James] Joyce is its ethnic
  hybridity: "Do we not see that in Ireland the Danes, the Firbolgs, the
  Milesians from Spain, the Norman invaders, and the Anglo-Saxon settlers have
  united to form a new entity, one might say under the influence of a local
  deity?" . . . The Irish language is almost as dead in Joyce's Dublin as Arawak
  is on [Derek] Walcott's Saint Lucia. A visiting English ethnographer, staying
  with Stephen and Mulligan in their Martello tower, confidently addresses an old
  milkwoman in Irish, only to find that she thinks he's speaking French. "I'm
  ashamed I don't speak the language myself," she confesses when he sets her
  straight; "I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows". With Gaelic lost
  outside Ireland's rural west, Joyce's Dubliners are caught between the stiff
  British English and the liveliness of their demotic brogue. It is a mark of
  their outsider status that neither Bloom nor Stephen speaks in Irish
  English . . . Again, like Walcott, Joyce seeks to reinvent English for his own
  purposes. He began by writing <i>Dubliners</i> in "a style of scrupulous
  meanness," as he told his publisher, using "meanness" in the sense of "penury,"
  as he thought he couldn't afford an extra adjective in his sentences. By the
  time of <i>Ulysses</i>, he was moving into a far more expansive—at times
  hallucinatory—language, which reaches its fullest embodiment in <i>Finnegans
  Wake</i> . . . A puzzled voice asks, "are we speaching d'anglas landage or are
  you sprakin sea Djoytsch?" Ireland is both: a land that is at sea.

  It is the natural course of affairs that a language morphs over time along with
  the people who use it. Such cultural artifacts combine and recombine in concert
  with the changes among the people. And these days, no one complains about the
  origins of the Arabic numerals while the world goes about using them.

  We conceive of this problem as essentially material: there cannot be real
  equality so long as different groups retain their patent material distinction,
  their clear separateness. So long as there remains material disparities between
  groups, irregularities in the grounded world, in manifest materiality, directly
  perceived through interactions and encounters with people and the constituents
  of social reality, of the artifacts of accomplishment, the edifices of human
  vestige of prior eras, divides along demographic lines are inevitable: the
  equality ideal exists in the same manner as psychic longing and unrealistic
  wishing. In the material view, no value is attached to any cultural
  association: no idea, achievement, object, person, culture, perspective is
  inherently associated with a grouping insofar as it is Western, Middle Eastern,
  African, Eastern, nor in such further subdivisions as British or French,
  Egyptian or Saudi Arabian. This is not to say that no such boundary exists to
  delineate such groupings, but that such groupings hold no inherent value and do
  not dole out the fixtures of people, places, and things to permanent
  compartments. In the material view, culture, spaces, people, are permeable,
  transitory, moldable, breathing, evolving, not confined by definitive,
  unbridgeable categories. In the material view, there is only what works and
  what succeeds in attaining a goal. There is no Western perspective, no Eastern
  perspective, no African perspective, to the extent that the perspective is
  intrinsically associated with the West, East, or Africa as a monolithic
  cultural frontier reflecting the unassailable character of some territory, but
  variations on the one unity of the human condition, each approach open and
  malleable to the others. There are no rigid cultural divides, and therefore no
  defining any approach as within or against any single perspective. No culture
  belongs to anyone or defines anyone, and no pride, no vanity, no ego needs be
  attached to association with any group. In the material view, convergence
  happens over time between cultures and people. This problem is, then,
  generational, and we should not be misled by the conceit that these issues will
  be solved in our lifetimes, and, even then, that they will be solved by us.

  It should be noted that this demographic change occurs only when the newcomers
  are not fenced into their own community, but rather when the new immerses with
  the old, and especially when the new occupies elite positions. This is
  precisely the case in our present political climate, not in the form of a
  sudden incursion, but through the gradual adoption of inclusiveness in
  academics, media, and political office, as liberals promote diversity.

  [I]t is better to risk being consigned by critics to the "hell" reserved for
  alleged Westernizers and imperialists—however unjustified such criticism would

  everyone will like what we are going to say. And what we are going to say is
  this: that there are universal obligations to protect human functioning and its
  dignity, and that the dignity of women is equal to that of men. If that
  involves assault on many local traditions, both Western and non-Western, so
  much the better, because any tradition that denies these things is unjust . . .
  Real cultures contain plurality and conflict, tradition, and subversion. They
  borrow good things from wherever they find them, none too worried about purity.
  We would never tolerate a claim that women in our own society must embrace
  traditions that arose thousands of years ago—indeed, we are proud that we have
  no such traditions. Isn't it condescending, then, to treat Indian and Chinese
  women as bound by the past in ways that we are not? . . . As Aristotle so
  simply puts it, "One may observe in one's travels to distance countries the
  feelings of recognition and affiliation that link every human being to every
  other human being." Kwame Anthony Appiah makes the same point, telling the
  story of his bicultural childhood. A child who visits one set of grandparents
  in Ghana and and another in rural England, who has a Lebanese uncle and who
  later, as an adult, has nieces and nephews from more than seven different
  nations, finds, he argues, not unbridgeable alien "otherness," but a great deal
  of human commonality.

  As this is a peaceful transition and not one with a forceful and immediate
  imposition, it retains certain properties of organic development and population
  drift. It seems there may be at least two phases involved in this process. The
  first phase, in a direction opposite to unification, rather emphasizes
  diversity, and it may well be the inundation of all the details of oppression,
  as we have seen in recent years on multiple fronts, but it is folly to subsist
  at length on such fledgling expressions and publicly enforced hysteria, as
  though society can carry on indefinitely with guilt, inhibition, and, by
  high-handed political pressure, promoting token diversity and inclusion,
  unloading a wave of sudden righteous signaling, mere appearances, and
  incoherent, arbitrary calls for progress under some tepid banner of supposed
  progress. After all, there is more that oppressed groups can offer than just
  proclaiming injustices, and they, too, are able to produce and compete when
  given adequate resources. For oppressed groups to stake a permanent flag in the
  ground, they must go beyond generating outcries and protests and voicing
  histories of persecution, beyond anger, loss, and pity—they must generate value
  and interest; rather than representing fear and displacement, they must embody
  excellence and triumph, prosperity and pride; to do so, they must accomplish.
  They must move into the next phase, which consists in this: those in
  historically marginalized groups must bolster fields other than that which
  serves their particular demographic group, to advance human civilization in
  areas other than race theory or gender studies. In this phase, there is hardly
  a need to advocate for diversity and inclusion because the various groups, with
  their capital, abilities, and ambitions, will represent themselves by their own
  right. And in doing so, their cultural attachments, associations, and identity
  attain attractive value and are absorbed into the predominant group, whose
  members are, like anyone else, naturally drawn to self-interest. The
  distinction which originally demarcated them as the other becomes a distinction
  within the norm, within the expectation, as they meld into the body itself, and
  they fold into the mainstream. What were formerly oppressed groups become
  heralded as a source of pride and another example in the long American
  tradition, and any influence of self-advantage are forgotten with the passing
  of time.

  We now turn to highlight the preeminence of self-interest, which runs in the
  background as a constant of human desire, and self-interest is the underlying
  motive of class distinction. As we have seen above with the example of
  England's population, groups are not definite and are liable to change,
  especially at times of demographic drift when over several generations new
  groups emerge. In this sense, there are absolute, real groups. Yet we must
  consider another aspect of grouping: individuals, at the level of perception,
  wish to identify with a privileged group to advance their interests. As we
  shall see, perceived groups can, on their own, even create a new category of
  groups. In this sense, groups can also be relative, and they form and reform
  around the perimeter of personal advantage. People associate with a group as
  befits the mood of the times and insofar as the group endows benefits to the
  individual.

  To provide an example of group relativity, let us consider how individuals come
  to identify with groups. We consider the German tribes of which the Angles and
  the Saxons were a part who later sailed and changed the population of England.
  We can refer to a text that has survived from that period, which comes from a
  foreigner's oppositional stance, Tacitus' GERMANIA. We appreciate the number of
  German tribes Tacitus mentions and the Roman's generally negative view towards
  barbarians:
  <blockquote>
  The Treveri and Nervii are ambitious of being thought of German origin; as if
  the reputation of this descent would distinguish them from the Gauls, whom they
  resemble in person and effeminacy. The Vangiones, Triboci, and Nemetes, who
  inhabit the bank of the Rhine, are without doubt German tribes . . .  Of all
  these people, the most famed for valor are the Batavi . . . Beyond these dwell
  the Catti . . . Next to the Catti, on the banks of the Rhine, where, now
  settled in its channel, it is become a sufficient boundary, dwell the Usipii
  and Tencteri . . . Contiguous to the Tencteri were formerly the Bructeri; but
  report now says that the Chamavi and Angrivarii . . . Contiguous to the
  Angrivarii and Chamavi backwards lie the Dulgibini, Chasauri . . . The Semnones
  assert themselves to be the most ancient and noble of the Suevi . . . The
  Langobardi, on the other hand, are ennobled by, the smallness of their numbers;
  since though surrounded by many powerful nations, they derive security, not
  from obsequiousness, but from their martial enterprise. The neighboring
  Reudigni, and the Avions, Angli, Varini, Eudoses, Suardones, and Nuithones, are
  defended by rivers or forests . . . On the right shore of the Suevic sea dwell
  the tribes of the Aestii . . . They worship the mother of the gods; and as the
  symbol of their superstition, they carry about them the figures of wild boars.
  This serves them in place of armor and every other defence: it renders the
  votary of the goddess safe even in the midst of foes. Their weapons are chiefly
  clubs, iron being little used among them. They cultivate corn and other fruits
  of the earth with more industry than German indolence commonly exerts . . .
  With the usual indifference of barbarians, they have not inquired or
  ascertained from what natural object or by what means it is produced.
  </blockquote>
  With these many tribes, it is quite stunning how many of their legacies have
  survived and how we today still hear of them, but, to preface the observation
  below of how later generations perceive the past, let us delineate the
  relativity of groups: mirroring the prevailing values and prejudices of the
  time, imagined groups will fragment, reform, shrink, or enlarge, subject to a
  running series of reconstitutions, redefinitions, reconstructions, and
  reinterpretations of historical lineage out of the crude circumstance that
  history as a retrospective imagination resides in the mind of the living. The
  facts and actualities, divisions and discord, uncertainties and
  inconsistencies, of past lives, relations, statehood, tribal and local
  animosity, the entirety of human civilization built century upon century along
  the greater march of millennia with all the irregular behavior due to
  individuals and their pressures, are lost to every new generation, which
  funnels the full raging river of the past through a tiny pore in the dam,
  filtered by self-interest.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  "Over there are the authors who have written about the decline of the mighty
  Roman Empire, which sprang up out of the ruins of so many monarchies, and on
  whose fall so many new ones sprang up also. An infinite number of barbarian
  peoples, as little known as the lands they inhabited, appeared suddenly,
  inundated and pillaged it, tore it to pieces and founded all the kingdoms that
  now compose Europe."

  It is rather remarkable that all the descendants of the many German tribes and
  also of the Gauls and the Franks, and all the various people the Romans deemed
  barbarians have proceeded to refer to the Roman writers, poets, and historians
  with such classic authority, that to identify with past scholarship, they flip
  to the other side, but the dam forcefully stops the flow of the river and the
  voices of the dead, letting only flattery and self-interest through the pore to
  the living. On this note, it is quite understandable that the Italian Petrarch
  should revive Cicero, but one must ponder how much has been forgotten
  (or willfully neglected?) over the centuries that the English, French, and
  German philosophers of the Enlightenment resort just as well to Roman
  antiquity. One even ventures to think that had the (formerly) living observed
  through the pore a searing divine light of the scorching skies, the messiah,
  granted a blissful blow of a blinding in the right eye, would have turned
  around to the people, exclaiming with great delight in interpreting the sign to
  be convincing proof that they had descended from a sun god.

  <blockquote>
  [M]yself and twenty more went to discover the island, and had not gone above

  discerned, importing, "Thus far travelled Hercules and Bacchus." . . .
  [W]e proceeded on our journey, and far we had not gone but we came to a river,
  the stream whereof seemed to run with as rich wine as any is made in Chios, and
  of a great breadth, in some places able to bear a ship, which made me to give
  the more credit to the inscription upon the pillar, when I saw such apparent
  signs of Bacchus's peregrination.

  which is so pervasive in Britain and the United States . . . Such an illusion
  of coherence is a product of modernist and colonialist discourse, which focuses
  on the 'other' and categorises itself as a a neutral 'same'. In reality,
  hybridity is a characteristic of all cultures . . . In order to give back
  meaning to the apparent emptiness of the 'white' category it is necessary to
  explore the specificity of white minority experiences . . . It
  [Richard Williams' analysis in his 1990 book, HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURES AND
  SOCIAL VALUE: THE CREATION OF BLACK AND IRISH IDENTITIES IN THE UNITED STATES]
  underlines the need to avoid essentialist definitions of groups according to
  shared origins. Being Irish in the United States has not been and is not the
  same as being Irish in Britain . . . [I]n Britain the Irish have been
  racialised as different, while in the United States they have been racialised
  as the same, but ethnicised as different. A central aspect of Irish people's
  movement into the centre of the American nation from an initial location on the
  margins was their 'whiteness' . . .
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iViHEBoAAAAJ&hl=en">David Roedinger</a> (1991)
  [in his book, THE WAGES OF WHITENESS,] offers a broader explanation for the
  emergence of whiteness as a significant social category. He relates this to the
  context of class formation rather than simply competition for jobs, and
  develops Du Bois' notion that the white working classes in America were
  persuaded to accept low monetary wages because of the compensatory 'wage' of
  public and psychological deference associated with being 'white'. They agreed
  to accept their inferior class position because they were 'not slaves' and 'not
  blacks'. Beyond this, whiteness was 'a way in which white workers responded to
  a fear of dependency on wage labour and to the necessities of capitalist work
  discipline' . . . An important issue is the extent to which the whiteness of
  Irish women enabled them to displace free black people in domestic service. If
  this is the case then women were in the vanguard of creating the 'wages of
  whiteness' whereby they accepted lower wages in return for preference over
  black people in a competitive labour market. Acceptance as white constituted
  part of the reward. This could be interpreted as a market decision in which
  individual Irish women were willing to undercut African-American women's wages
  because of their own need . . . [T]his initial phase of competition was not in
  itself a 'race' issue, a term which could not be applied until systematic
  exclusion by unions used whiteness as a condition of employment in certain
  industries . . . The hegemony which had originally been centred on
  the 'Anglo-Saxon race' alone was not finally widened to include other white
  Europeans until there was a need to reconsolidate the racial order after the
  tremendous disruption to it threatened by the abolition of slavery.

  And with the dawn of this new group came the possibility of such a term and
  accusation as Eurocentrism, predicated on self-interest. That class, resources,
  and material affiliation are the essential components of race analysis is
  echoed in the 2005 book, RACIAL ENCOUNTER, by
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8q_6IycAAAAJ&hl=en">Kevin Durrheim</a>
  and
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZC4BBUQAAAAJ&hl=en">John Dixon</a>,
  about their research on continued segregation in post-apartheid South Africa.
  They inform their analysis with American research, writing:
  <blockquote>
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W0FkwHEAAAAJ&hl=en">Goldberg</a>
  (1998) [in this
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1090-9524(99)80184-3">paper</a>]
  suggests that a new segregation emerged in the USA in the era ushered in by the
  1954 <i>Brown</i> context combined to produce a form of segregation that was
  <i>conservationist</i>, <i>preference driven</i>, and <i>class
  differentiated</i>. Whereas the old segregation had been activist, produced by
  active political and legislative intervention, and self-consciously designed to
  produce segregated spaces, the new segregation simply tries to preserve the
  social hierarchy already produced by the history of segregation. It does this
  by 'desegregating' society, dismantling the legal and political edifice of
  segregation and attacking them as illiberal. In their place, the new
  segregation is preference driven: 'it is produced by doing nothing special,
  nothing beyond being guided by the presumptive laws of the market, the
  determinations of the majority's personal preferences' . . . The new
  segregation is not statutory but comes into existence through individuals
  exercising their preferences to live in neighborhoods of their choice and to
  send their children to schools of their choice. Finally, the new segregation is
  not monolithic, but rather class differentiated. It is race-neutral, rejecting
  the illiberal monolithic exclusion of people on the basis of skin colour in
  favour of an individualistic system whereby people occupy the spaces they can
  afford . . . Goldberg's thesis is that the immediate agent of the new
  segregation is no longer state legislation but individual subjects, who bring
  about collective patterns of segregation in the routine choices and preferences
  they enact in their everyday lives. The ways in which individual preferences
  produce collective patterns of segregation are readily evident in our
  observations on Scottburgh beach . . . Individuals have the freedom to sit
  wherever they like on the beach, and yet they exercised these choices in a way
  that produced the kinds of racial clustering we observed. In such
  post-apartheid contexts, attitudes take on a prominent role in shaping
  preferences and sustaining segregation.
  </blockquote>
  Although they observe the overlapping effects of race and class, Durrheim and
  Dixon warn against explanations that reduce these forms of class-derived racial
  self-segregation solely to class-based interpretations of these behaviors and
  preferences. However, they do not offer a substantive argument for their
  stance; it is my view that race on its own has certain effects on grouping, but
  relations between groups and also within a given group are defined and
  sustained primarily through class difference, through material inequality,
  which generates further consequences in power disparity. It seems to me more
  accurate to characterize race as operating within the more general domain of
  class, and the behavior of continued racial segregation in the post-apartheid
  and post-Jim Crow era reflects the the material inequalities between racial
  groups in which individuals prefer associations which serve their interests.

  Like Durrheim and Dixon,
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JE85Ie8AAAAJ&hl=en">Lawrence Bobo</a>
  proposed a similar idea on the modern, free-market form of racial discrimination
  since the collapse of legalized segregation. Bobo, in the 1997 book,
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.5040/9798216188131">RACIAL ATTITUDES IN THE 1990S</a>
  gave his approach a name he included in his chapter title, LAISSEZ-FAIRE
  RACISM. In Bobo's words:
  <blockquote>
  Rather than relying on state-enforced inequality as during the Jim Crow era,
  however, modern racial inequality relies on the market and informal racial bias
  to re-create, and in some instances sharply worsen, structured racial
  inequality. Hence, laissez-faire racism.
  </blockquote>
  Bobo claims that the modern view towards disparate racial outcomes is that the
  shortcomings are due to individual choices and cultural deficiencies:
  <blockquote>
  Laissez-faire racism is crystallizing in the current period as a new U.S. racial
  belief system at a point when African Americans are a heavily urbanized,
  nationally dispersed, and occupationally heterogeneous population; when state
  policy is formally race neutral and committed to antidiscrimination efforts;
  and when most white Americans prefer a more volitional and cultural, as opposed
  to inherent and biological, interpretation of blacks' disadvantaged status.
  </blockquote>
  Bobo further describes between power relations between groups:
  <blockquote>
  The real attitude object is relative group positions. This attitude of sense of
  group position is historically and culturally rooted, socially learned, and
  modifiable in response to new information, events, or structural conditions, as
  long as these factors contribute to or shape contexts for social interactions
  among members of different groups. Attitudes toward integration or toward
  blacks are, fundamentally, statements about preferred positional relations
  among racial groups.
  </blockquote>
  Despite acknowledging this factor of group positioning and also the fact that
  this discrimination occurs within the forces of the free market, Bobo resists
  describing this group dynamic as class-based. Even earlier this year in a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6vm2uv2rnY">lecture</a>,
  Bobo heavily relied on economic metrics as a barometer for racial equality. But
  in the book, he isolates the non-redeeming effect of class on Black individuals
  and families, writing:
  <blockquote>
  [S]igns of negative racial attitudes are borne out by a number of tangible
  indicators, such as the burgeoning evidence of racial discrimination
  experienced by blacks almost irrespective of social class background . . .
  African Americans . . . remain economically disadvantaged and racially
  segregated despite growing class heterogeneity within the black community and
  despite the successes of the civil rights movement
  </blockquote>
  I disagree with Bobo on this point that these groups are not class-based. His
  examples do not adequately capture the influence of class because the
  individuals in question are exceptions to the rule in a society which is
  predominated by another group, which regards these class-advantaged individuals
  Bobo mentions not solely through the individual's class but also through the
  individual's group's class. We must resist the temptation to examine an
  individual's class standing and derive immediate conclusions about societal
  dynamics at the intersection of race and class as though one person exerts
  considerable impact on relations within societal affairs. The broad scale of
  the historical arc and its momentum are not physical laws wherein every example
  must conform to the hard fact of reality: an individual in society is situated
  within the aftermath of historical pressure and prior conditioning. We should
  speak not of an individual's class but of the class of that individual's
  perceived group—to be more specific, as no group can be described as a uniform
  class, we must speak of the distribution of the group's class composition and
  ask towards which direction it skews. To speak of experimenting with higher
  class is to elevate not just an individual's standing but the group's
  distribution, and then this elevation must persist over generations to alter
  the tract of historical inertia. As class consists not only of resource
  possession and market share but also political power, academic authority,
  flattering media narratives and celebrity clout, class privilege pervades the
  various sectors of society. Through higher class standing, the group becomes
  aspirational: it has power and resources and representation, it sets social
  values and agendas, it occupies an exclusive echelon, and association with the
  group affords privileges. In the face of this change, the current populace
  either resists, ignores, or conforms to the new group, but the next generation,
  growing up in its jurisdiction, brought up in its image, and taught its
  customs, automatically identify with the new power. This range of predicates is
  what experimenting with class entails, not in the examples of limited scope
  Bobo considers in which individuals operate within the power of another group.
  The difficulty of this task and the scope of such a demographic shift is what
  we must consider when we wish to understand the effects of class. However, we
  need not plan out and implement such a long and arduous course of events since
  we can recourse to a thought experiment to appreciate its manifestation. While
  in Bobo's example, an individual with higher class standing is an exception to
  the rule, as the individual, regardless of his class, is viewed not only
  through class evaluation but also through his relation to the hegemony and
  therefore does not reap the full advantages of class; on the contrary, under
  this new scheme of the elevation of the individual's group, class hegemony
  reverses: the individual under these new social parameters becomes part of the
  hegemon, and race is only the incidental trait that tenuously coalesces the
  members of this hegemon into a group. Although the group remains racially the
  same as before, class advantage and class privilege have shifted the group's
  position. It is not race, then, that is the essential factor in a
  market-oriented society, but class and class power.

  We have considered how race is only a secondary attribute to class in what are
  usually called race relations. Much of the reasoning I have outline above can
  be extended to tensions arising from gender differentials—it is class,
  resources, and power which undergird the surface divide. The accumulation of
  resources and capital which constitute a class construct encompasses the
  natural inequalities in ability and ambition, of labor and discipline.
  Commenting on the cause of lingering gender inequality decades ago, despite
  women having attained some degree of freedom and independence, Beauvoir writes
  on the importance of achievement in THE SECOND SEX:
  <blockquote>
  Most women, though, do not understand the problems that their desire for
  communication poses: and this is what largely explains their laziness. They
  have always considered themselves as givens; they believe their worth comes
  from an inner grace, and they do not imagine that value can be acquired; to
  seduce, they know only how to display themselves: their charm works or does not
  work, they have no grasp on its success or failure; they suppose that in a
  similar way, to express oneself, one need only show what one is; instead of
  constituting their work by a thoughtful effort, they put their confidence in
  spontaneity; writing or smiling is all one to them: they try their luck,
  success will come or not. Sure of themselves, they reckon that the book or
  painting will be successful without effort; timid, they are discouraged by the
  least criticism; they do not know that error can open the road to progress,
  they take it for an irreparable catastrophe, like a malformation . . .
  [T]hey become irritated and discouraged when recognizing their errors rather
  than drawing valuable lesons from them . . . Instead of giving herself
  generously to the work she undertakes, the woman all too often considers it a
  simple ornament of her life; books and paintings are only an inessential
  intermediary allowing her to exhibit this essential reality publicly: her own
  person . . . The writer who is original, as long as he is not dead, is always
  scandalous; what is new disturbs and antagonizes; women are still astonished
  and flattered to be accepted into the world of thinking and art, a masculine
  world: the woman watches her manners; she does not dare to irritate, explore,
  explode; she thinks she has to excuse her literary pretensions by her modesty
  and good taste; she relies on the proven values of conformism; . . . she points
  out that she is a woman with some well-chosen affectations, simpering, and
  preciosities; so she will excel at producing "best sellers," but she cannot be
  counted on to blaze new trails . . . And to an even greater extent we can count
  on the fingers of one hand the women who have traversed the given in search of
  its secret dimension: Emily Brontë explored death, Virginia Woolf life, and
  Katherine Mansfield sometimes—not very often—daily contingence and suffering.
  No woman ever wrote <i>The Trial</i>, <i>Moby-Dick</i>, <i>Ulysses</i>, or
  <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>. Women do not challenge the human condition
  because they have barely begun to be able to assume it entirely. This explains
  why their works generally lack metaphysical resonance and black humor as well;
  they do not set the world apart, they do not question it, they do not denounce
  its contradictions: they take it seriously . . . Her "world of ideas" are not
  necessarily different from men's, because she will free herself by assimilating
  them; to know how singular she will remain and how important these
  singularities will continue to be, one would have to make some foolhardy
  predictions. What is beyond doubt is that until now women's possibilities have
  been stifled and lost to humanity, and in her and everyone's interest it is
  high time she be left to take her own chances.
  </blockquote>
  Very much in line with my view on the issues of both race and gender, Janet
  Saltzman Chafetz describes the problem as she sees it in GENDER EQUITY:
  <blockquote>
  Power permits men to devalue women's work and assign devalued work to women. The
  ultimate target of change is, therefore, the demise of male superiority in
  resource power. However, in saying this I am simply using other words to say
  that the ultimate target is the demise of gender stratification . . . While it
  is of fundamental importance that women earn rewards (resources) equal to men
  from their work, if they remain excluded from that minority of work roles that
  constitutes the elite, any improvement in their relative status is at best
  tenuous . . . Elites are vitally concerned with protecting—if not
  enhancing—their own positions . . . Equal access to elite roles constitutes the
  most difficult and intractable problem in achieving gender equality. Yet
  without it, all other improvements in women's relative status remain
  incomplete, fragile, and easily lost . . . In a fundamental way, my theoretical
  logic has led me to a conclusion that I find discomfiting . . . As long as men
  are more powerful than women, especially at the macro level, what women do and
  value will be relatively devalued according to general social definitions. Only
  in assuming nondomestic, and specifically elite, roles can women hope to
  contribute substantially to the formulation of general social values and
  policies. Yet in order to achieve such roles, more often than not women must
  sacrifice to a substantial degree those very values and behaviors that are
  often defined as distinctively feminine. To enter elite roles, they must
  resemble the elites already there . . . Equality usually entails assimilation,
  and traditional values rarely survive that process . . . Many radical feminists
  reject the entire notion of power and elites as part of a future society based
  on feminist values. They define such inequality as the product of male
  dominance (patriarchy) and, therefore, as a central target to be eliminated. I
  might wish to agree with them ideologically, but sociologically I see no chance
  that human societies will return to substantial social egalitarianism.
  </blockquote>
  If we consider the examples of Michelle Obama, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader
  Ginsburg, their life trajectories and outcomes, I'm not sure if it is justified
  or proper to feel entitled to the contentment of "I show up, therefore I am,"
  because examples of success and triumph seem to me born from continual struggle
  with industrious capacity for work through tribulation.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  For if truth be at all within the reach of human capacity, 'tis certain it must
  lie very deep and abstruse; and to hope we shall arrive at it without pains,
  while the greatest geniuses have failed with the utmost pains, must certainly
  be esteemed sufficiently vain and presumptuous.

  Even a feminist as radical as Germaine Greer, who favors viewing women not in
  relation to men but as independents on their own terms, predicates her position
  on differential quality, on hierarchy even within the woman's realm, on merit.
  Her book, THE OBSTACLE RACE, uncovers women painters and their works and
  struggles in the history of art, whose representation has conventionally been
  prevailed by men. Greer describes how it is specifically material achievement
  that should be a woman's aspiration, not indulging or celebrating the mere
  presence of women in formerly men's spaces or the sole fact that she produces
  work, regardless of quality:
  <blockquote>
  The intention [of this book] is to show women artists not as a string of
  over-rated individuals but as members of a group having much in common,
  tormented by the same conflicts of motivation and the same practical
  difficulties, the obstacles both external and surmountable, internal and
  insurmountable of the race for achievement . . . If we look fearlessly at the
  works of dead women and do not attempt to erect for them a double standard in
  the mistaken notion that such distortion of the truth will benefit women living
  and working today, we will understand by analogy a good deal about our own
  oppression and its pathology. We will see all the signs of self-censorship,
  hypocritical modesty, insecurity, girlishness, self-deception, hostility
  towards one's fellow strivers, emotional and sexual dependency upon men,
  timidity, poverty and ignorance. All these traits of the oppressed personality
  are only to be expected; the astonishing and gratifying thing is that so many
  women conquered all of these enemies within some of the time, most often when
  they were young, before marriage and childbirth or poverty and disillusionment
  took their toll. Their defeats can teach us about the nature of their struggle;
  their successes assure us that we too can do it . . . Most of us, despite our
  schools' insistence that anyone can draw, are not artists: it is to our
  advantage to become the women artists' audience, not in a foolishly partisan
  way so that anything a woman does is good in our eyes, but to offer the kind of
  constructive criticism and financial, intellectual and emotional support that
  men have given their artists in the past. The first prerequisite is knowledge,
  not only of women's work but of the men's work to which it relates, and not in
  vague generalisations but precise examples. The young Californian women who
  came to the 'Women Painters: 1550-1950' exhibition in Los Angeles were often
  disappointed to see how closely the women's work related to that of the men,
  whom they knew more about, and many of them lost interest right there. That
  should have been the starting point, for understanding how women artists
  sometimes led men, were plundered and overtaken, is an important part of
  recovering our history.
  </blockquote>
  In stressing the significance of class, I am not saying that this variable
  should be the sole element in the discourse on societal inequality, but that it
  is the essential root; nor am I saying that individuals can be reduced to their
  class position and valued according to it, but that much of the attention given
  to race and gender should instead be redirected towards class. Richard Reeves
  remarks in DREAM HOARDERS of the common perception in the country which he
  spends the rest of the book shamelessly and truthfully dismantling:
  <blockquote>
  Drawing class distinctions feels almost un-American. The nation's self-image is
  of a classless society, one in which every individual is of equal worth,
  regardless of his or her economic status.
  </blockquote>
  Considering someone's socioeconomic class, especially when class is the more
  substantive factor, should not be more taboo than that person's race or gender,
  which in the norms of the present is rather commonplace. It is self-deception
  to carry on with our days negligent to class divides which presently continue
  to grow. To this end, diversity initiatives should encompass not just race and
  gender but also class background.

  I wish to briefly add my view on diversity. For all the current climate
  promoting diversity and inclusion, I contend no one can speak for his or her or
  their group better than the person's own self. What does representation in
  television and film entail? The essence is a script, a director, actors, and
  funding—and how is even a legitimate, authentic script going to come from
  someone without the cultural exposure, background, mindset, linguistic
  familiarity, experiential grounding for such representation to be valid,
  compelling, genuine beyond projected abstraction?
  <a href="https://kabiristyping.com">Kabbit Chipper</a>
  recently
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/31/magazine/hollywood-movies-race-diversity.html">reflected</a>
  in The New York Times on the sudden preoccupation with multiracial
  representation. But who are the people creating these representations, where is
  their money coming from, and what part of the market are they catering to?
  <a href="https://wcet.wiche.edu/people/chris-gilliard/">Chris Gilliard</a>
  also recently
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/google-gemini-diverse-nazis/677575/">jeered</a>
  in The Atlantic on how the pressure for diversity has led to generative AI that
  retrospectively distorts history. I think the push for diversity is the right
  step, but it ought to be done properly, not through flagrant deviations from
  reality or absurd fantasies. As a matter of fact, I think this push for
  diversity is an intitial step towards competitive progress and better
  innovation, not as an end on its own insofar as it is expected to sustain
  itself. Better yet—training wheels off, political ideology tossed to the wind,
  empty sympathy dismissed, can a work predicated on diversity stand against its
  leading competitors? If so, we're talking about a different game, and I'm
  listening.

  I contend that, in the end, the ideal of diversity and inclusion must prove
  itself as a sustainable component in a productive society, that it is
  ultimately not propped up by artificial means but is rather a natural outgrowth
  of competitive abilities among all demographic groups. I argue for, after the
  lapse of diversity initiatives, which cannot last indefinitely, an organic
  growth of diversity not through top-down imposition but by natural occurrence,
  and the resultant scope of diversity reflects the distribution of abilities. I
  argue that for diversity to sustain itself, abilities themselves must manifest
  throughout demographic groups. Specifically, attributes such as female-led,
  Black-founded, Asian-represented, will not need promotion and elevation outside
  of the marketplace's demand by consumers who choose what interests them,
  because such attributes will already be integrated into the flux of economic
  competition, of supply and demand—that demographic groups can represent
  themselves not through intrusive political pressure but because of integrative
  competitive ability. Perchance organique greens muncheth le rabbit, so
  organique kale in der liberal Salat, aye diversity the rub! Durst dream
  contumely, whips and scorn? Bee thee, or nay thee bee? Bee be bee? As o'er 'tis
  undiscover'd co'ntry, ton'ght sle'p d'vers'tee—he hath a dream! Doth nein! In
  mute grey or in color? How, be one race another? Calamity of long life, no
  traveller returns. Sling an arrow unto poor bee, sweet is the honey. How can
  one bee but be organique, representation in the high tree?

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  For all artists the problem is one of finding one's own authenticity, of
  speaking in a language or imagery that is essentially one's own, but if one's
  self-image is dictated by one's relation to others and all one's activities are
  other-directed, it is simply not possible to find one's own voice . . .
  Feminism cannot supply the answer for an artist, for her truth cannot be
  political. She cannot abandon the rhetoric of one group for the rhetoric of
  another, or substitute acceptability to one group for acceptability to
  another . . . The point is, after all, not to question irritably whether women
  artists are any good in order to reject them if we find that they are not as
  good as another group, but to interest ourselves in women artists, for their
  dilemma is our own. Every painting by anyone is evidence of a struggle, and not
  all such struggles are conclusively won.

  I make the following comments as a guiding principle on future direction because
  it is tempting to be blinded by the prevailing mood of the time and the
  tendency to accentuate demographic divisions. Certainly, discrimination exists
  and measures should be taken to remediate the ensuing inequalities, but we
  should not, in our discontent, protests, resentment, reactionary attitudes, in
  our polarized society informed daily by divisive media, lose sight of what the
  end goal resembles. So long as one sees race or gender as a critical factor in
  societal relations, it will remain a preconceived projection onto situations
  even where such a factor is not relevant, as with the whole line of other
  demographic attributes as age, religion, even class. What I am saying is not
  that prejudice does not exist, but the direction to which the public should
  aspire is not to press social divisions as though they are principal elements
  in themselves which commence with the first word and continue until the last,
  to persist into perpetuity, but to reach a situation where it is no longer
  necessary to remain cognizant of these traits. In an ideal society of equals
  consisting of people from all ages, religions, genders, races, from all walks
  of life, it is difficult to imagine situations completely free of demographic
  difference, and emphasizing those very fault lines may not only be
  counterproductive but also constitute precisely the reason for actual division
  through a perception of separation. Where one sees race, so every racial divide
  slides into racism; so too with gender and the rest.

  Much work remains to be done to reach racial and gender equality. However, in an
  ideal and equal society, the fact of becoming a woman is a difference, but not
  one that warrants undue, raucous weight. And, in such an ideal society, the
  propositions of gender theory having prevailed, the dominant social norm has
  embraced the idea that gender is a performative, fluid construct, where any
  gender can be adopted with impunity and inconsequence. In this society, what,
  then, is the point of calling attention to anyone's demographic attributes?
  Indeed, the aspirational end should not be a public rallying cry of: "I am a
  woman in this place, and I am proud," but rather in the manner of bemusement,
  of responding to a question that is beside the point, of minor annoyance at
  having to bother with an inquirer who just walked into the room and has no idea
  what has happened: "I am a woman in this place, but it doesn't matter."

  The strife and journey towards wealth, education, culture, travailing over race,
  gender, religion, class, national borders, age, generations, may just be more
  things to occupy our time, and after reaching the goal through all the
  complaint and struggle, all the protests, contention, resistance, all the
  backlash and reinstatement, all the new norms and novelty, all the flickering
  triumph and reassurance, one may, in the aftermath of the victory, immersed
  again in the commotion of daily life, the dust having settled, realize that the
  reward might not be as spectacular as one had imagined.

  The writer was lounging in a coffee shop one afternoon nursing his thoughts to
  tune of his whims when on the television, news broke of O.J. Simpson's death,
  and out came a whole pouring of footage of the highly publicized events of his
  life, a retrospective of his football career, the car chase, court trial, the
  robbery, and commentary over this montage. The writer reflected to himself: for
  all the attention and media coverage of this man's incidents and episodes, he's
  dead now, and what will all these outrages have mattered in the end? This
  observation is not limited to this person, but to everyone: what lives on after
  people perish, and how many will remember that person? And then decades later,
  after even these people pass on, how many of those remaining still remember or
  even come to know of it at all? Taking this idea further: of the records of
  human activity over history, of all the books in the libraries of the world,
  the whole of lives, eras, civilizations, how many read them? Who knows of them?
  What passes on?

  Books, authors, celebrities, names—what lives on? A generation or two later,
  after the tide of their fashion and renown, what remains? Surely this must be
  why ancient scholarship, texts, and writers are lost, and even the insights
  from just two generations prior are prone to collect dust: what does it matter
  that they physically reside somewhere if they are not read and comprehended? Do
  they exist if no one knows?

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  What a place to be in is an old library! It seems as though all the souls of all
  the writers that have bequeathed their labours to the Bodleian were reposing

  as the first bloom of the sciential apples which grew around the happy

  Though they may be stored on a library shelf, on an internet page, in the
  archives of a magazine or broadcasting network, how many these records are, so
  vast and unyielding, impossible to consume even any meaningful portion, so many
  falling trees in the forest when no one's around, that they, sitting in their
  eternal silence, may as well not exist, unknown and fading, unless they also
  live in someone's mind. It may be that we do not accumulate upon an ever
  growing pile of expertise in a continual forward movement of progress, because
  the pile sits on drain grates over a void, and only that which is most recent
  and seemingly relevant to the present eyes survives. Is there a carrying
  capacity of known knowledge?

  Let us consider a field populated by people, with all the trappings of objects,
  society, nature. We make two observations:

  It is impossible to know everyone<br>
  It is impossible to read everything

  In this field, other individuals, like us, are constained by time, energy,
  attentional bandwidth, bound by locale, and within these same parameters they,
  too, are confronted with the same problem: how to operate within this field?

  Fortunately, an individual is not presented the overwhelming magnitude of the
  task and the infinitude of options but is confined by pressures: social and
  familial ties, linguistic restrictions, societal expectations, educational and
  work demands, and so the scope of the problem diminishes so drastically as to
  fit into an individually manageable scale. Still, within these confines, there
  remains free time and choice. How do individuals spend these limited resources?
  We assume that everyone operates according to some priority of values and
  self-interest. Some prefer hedonism, some piety, some duty, some freedom, some
  adventure and passion, some community, some are inclined to the outdoors, some
  to intellectual pursuit, some to religion, some to wealth, some to simply
  enjoying the moment. Each, then, operates according to what best serves the
  individuals's interests. But the field is noisy and full of others who seek to
  further their own gains through deception. How, then, does an individual
  determine where to go, who to believe, what to consume? Every direction is vast
  beyond any individual's comprehension, and whichever one chooses, one can
  frolic on the surface and at best can only make scratchings at depth.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  I know my foolishness, a mere ant trying to shake a tree;<br>
  Such is the tyro's urge, ever to criticize.<br>
  With old age, leaving behind a thousand poems—<br>
  By whom will their strengths and weaknesses by judged?

  <br>

  Who to know, what to know, what to consume are not entirely up to an
  individual's exploration and choice, for time, energy, finances, and attention
  are precious and limited resources, and out of convenience an individual must
  depend on social information: hearsay, reviews both professional and amateur,
  accolades and awards, notoriety, reputable references from trusted sources.
  Everyone in the field subject to these pressures, we may draw an inkling of an
  individual's path through the field, haphazard, swaying, unfocused. If we model
  individual human trajectories based not primarily on reason, optimization,
  logic, but on randomness, environmental factors, coincidental encounters,
  happenstance, stumbling, blundering, grasping in the dark forest where reason
  is only the thin beam of the wavering flashlight shining ahead, we may
  understand more accurately a person's behavior, knowledge, experiences over the
  course of a lifetime, not through lofty, honorable principles and ideals but a
  grounding in the material world of circumstances, availability, demands,
  options, in purview of the community's knowledge, the circumstances of birth.
  Yet each individual, out of self-protection and self-interest, projects a
  persona of resolve and determination so that in the absence of any real
  clarity, one bluffs, and others perceive the posturing as certitude and
  conviction.

  What we fill our time with may be more prone to the whims of the moment, an

  When we think to attach ourselves to any point and to fasten to it, it wavers
  and leaves us; and if we follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and
  vanishes for ever. Nothing stays for us. This is our natural condition, and yet
  most contrary to our inclination; we burn with desire to find solid ground and

<u id="kant-schopenhauer">Confinement: Kant, and Desire: Schopenhauer</u><br>

  We saw in the meritocracy section how advantage passes down over generations. It
  is worth asking: why does the upper middle class continue to hoard privilege?

  What do established elites wish to attain in the restless struggle and merciless
  meritocratic competition? We can readily resort to answers based on
  evolutionary instincts, although this competition hardly poses any threat to
  survival, or predicated upon the risk of elites fearing their children will
  lose their esteemed position, but these would be only cursory responses that do
  not address the fundamental issue. Instead of these preliminary questions, we
  must inquire deeper and seek the underlying framework on which these questions,
  among many others relating to incentives and purpose—what motivates people?
  What causes the striving and movements of animals? The question: what is the
  nature of desire?

  The writer bids the reader have patience, for we must entertain two philosophers
  because—who knew?—they remain relevant. This section delves into some of their
  ideas and builds up to the question we have posed. Kant writes in CRITIQUE OF
  PURE REASON, among its ensuing concepts, the dense philosophical treatment of
  an idea, of which the following example is a consequence. A snake looking at a
  red apple doesn't see what we understand to be red. We can, with our
  technology, map a snake's visual system onto ours so we can see what the snake
  does, but how many visual systems are out there we don't about? As we keep
  expanding our technology to encompass them, how do we know we've covered them
  all? And for colors, our retinal composition is limited to what lay between
  violet and red. But the red apple: that it is red, tastes sweet, is round,
  indeed every one of its attributes we perceive, must come through the senses
  peculiar to our bodies. Because of this constraint by limited senses, the red
  apple is a <i>snippet</i>, just one <i>side</i> out of many, of what the red
  apple actually is in its totality, which we cannot perceive. This is one form
  of limitation on the possibilities of our knowledge. Yet Kant's reasoning goes
  one step further: our mental faculties, too, are limited. Our capacity for
  understanding operates within the domains of space, time, and causality,
  confined to spatiotemporal observation and chronological causation. For
  instance, we cannot jump between these three: we cannot reason in time as we do
  in space. Spatially, we can reason with the whole of a line drawn on paper, but
  we cannot reason with the totality of time as though we can comprehend at once
  all movements that happen over time; if we could, it would be in our power to
  turn and rotate that temporal line, skip back and forth at will, as well as
  understand how it interacts with what else may lay on the paper. But we don't;
  our mental modes are bound by our particular renditions of space, of time, of
  causality. Just as a snake sees thermal heat and perceives this as the whole
  world, so the red apple is our <i>image</i>, our <i>construction</i>, as much
  as that red apple has attributes beyond our perception. More generally, Kant
  merged the two philosophical strains of his time, rationalism and empiricism,
  by claiming that our understanding of the world must consist of both our inborn
  mental intuitions and of our experiences of external objects, but in this
  merging Kant showed also that both fronts, our internal reasoning capacity and
  our perception of the external world, reside in limitation, providing a
  systematic bound on what we can possibly know.

  Kant is not saying that things do not exist and our experiences are imaginary
  and solely in our minds—rather, things external to us very much do exist, but
  our perceptions of them are limited by our confined sensing and mental modes.
  If we plucked an apple from a tree, we perceive the apple as having been
  separated from the tree and other apples, but is that separation of space real,
  or is it perceived to be so by our limited faculties because we do not see that
  in two additional dimensions, the apple and the tree, like all things, are in
  fact physically still connected? We, as perceiving subjects in the world,
  cannot understand the world independently of our perception to it—we are
  complicit in creating the space, time, and causality in our understanding of
  the world. Kant is saying it is nonsense, if we remove ourselves from the
  scenery, to assume that the world as we know it will remain fixed as we humans
  have perceived it, because this construct is our representation of the world
  which we ourselves, with our particular sensory inlets and our particular
  mental apparatus, bring to the table—this image is our life-world, and if we
  disappear, so does this representation.

  <i>The Human Condition</i> [a painting] was the solution to the problem of the

  representing exactly that part of the landscape hidden from view by the
  painting. Therefore, the tree represented in the painting hid from view the
  real tree situated behind it, outside the room. The tree existed for the
  spectator, as it were, simultaneously in his mind, as both inside the room in
  the painting, and outside in the real landscape. Which is how we see the world:
  we see it as being outside ourselves even though it is only a mental
  representation of it that we experience inside ourselves. In the same way, we
  sometimes situate in the past a thing which is happening in the present. Time
  and space thus lose that unrefined meaning which is the only one daily
  experience takes into account.

  related to his sense of sight. In the case of a bird the problem is different
  again, and so on and so forth. This probably explains why most truly great
  minds have preferred 'nature' to human society. The latter limits, the former
  liberates and helps us beyond the confines of humanity. And in so doing it

  themselves for the other person . . . In the Neuchâtel manuscript of <i>Les

  We are now ready to encounter Schopenhauer. He has a reputation for pessimism,
  so I don't want to linger on him for long, but his insights on desire, in my
  view, stands on firm ground and motivates some of the later ideas in this post.
  I want to divide this discussion of his ideas into two sections: his
  metaphysics (which I will explain briefly, though I'm not so sure on how valid
  it is) and the psychological consequences (which are very real and poignant;
  this is the point of this topic). First, metaphysics: Schopenhauer writes in
  THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION, in the Payne translation:
  <blockquote>
  We have learnt from the great Kant that time, space, and causality are present
  in our consciousness according to their whole conformity to rule and the
  possibility of all their forms, quite independently of the objects that appear
  in them and form their content . . . Whatever the thing-in-itself may be, Kant
  rightly concluded that time, space, causality . . . could not be its
  properties, but could come to it only after, and in so far as, it had become
  representation, in other words, belonged only to its phenomenon or appearance,
  not to it itself . . . The form is originally foreign to it, . . ., can
  therefore never be completely <i>fathomed</i>. Therefore, although all
  mathematics give us exhaustive knowledge of that which in phenomena is
  quantity, position, number, in short, spatial and temporal relation; although
  etiology tells us completely about the regular conditions under which
  phenomena, with all their determinations, appear in time and space, yet, in
  spite of all this, teaches us nothing more than why in each case every definite
  phenomenon must appear just at this time here and just at this place now, we
  can never with their assistance penetrate into the inner nature of things.
  </blockquote>
  Schopenhauer conceives of the world as a duality: on the one hand is a single,
  undifferentiated unity of will, the unknowable thing-in-itself, which we cannot
  possibly perceive because it does not reside in space or time, and on the other
  is our representation of this will, which is all the phenomena in this world we
  do perceive. But further: space and time in the phenomenal world fragment the
  will into pluralities—and here begins the psychological section—all forces and
  living creatures are instances of the will, everything striving and struggling
  in its will to live, competing against one another, failing to recognize
  everything and everyone else is also oneself, all part of the will. Each
  individual desires and fights for its survival and growth, yet the objects one
  desires—satisfaction, happiness, gratification—dissipate soon after one attains
  them, and they never last and are therefore only illusory. More precisely, this
  passage summarizes Schopenhauer's psychological ideas:
  <blockquote>
  We have already seen in nature-without-knowledge her inner being as a constant
  striving without aim and without rest, and this stands out much more distinctly
  when we consider the animal or man. Willing and striving are its whole essence,
  and can be fully compared to an unquenchable thirst. The basis of all willing,
  however, is need, lack, and hence pain. If, on the other hand, it lacks objects
  of willing, because it is at once deprived of them again by too easy a
  satisfaction, a fearful emptiness and boredom come over it; in other words, its
  being and its existence itself become an intolerable burden for it. Hence its
  life swings like a pendulum to and fro between pain and boredom, and these two
  are in fact its ultimate constituents. This has been expressed very quaintly by
  saying that, after man had placed all pains and torments in hell, there was
  nothing left for heaven but boredom.
  </blockquote>
  Expanding further, Schopenhauer writes in a manner faithful to his popular
  image:
  <blockquote>
  [T]he satisfaction or the pleasing can never be more than the deliverance from a
  pain, from a want . . . It is, however, hard to attain or achieve anything;
  difficulties and troubles without end are opposed to every purpose, and at
  every step hindrances accumulate. But when finally everything is overcome and
  attained, nothing can ever be gained but deliverance from some sorrow or
  desire, so that we find ourselves in just the same position as we occupied
  before this sorrow or desire appeared . . . The satisfaction and the pleasure
  we can know only indirectly through the remembrance of the preceding suffering
  and want, which cease with their appearance. Hence it arises that we are not
  properly conscious of the blessings and advantages we actually possess, nor do
  we prize them; but we think of them merely as a matter of course, for they
  gratify us only negatively by restraining suffering . . . That all happiness is
  only of a negative, not a positive, nature, that just on this account it cannot
  furnish lasting satisfaction and gratification, but merely delivers us from
  some pain or want which must be followed either by a new pain, or by languor,
  empty longing, and <i>ennui</i>—this finds support in art, that true mirror of
  the world and life . . . Every epic and dramatic poem can represent only a
  struggle, an effort, a fight for happiness, but never enduring and complete
  happiness itself. It conducts its heroes through a thousand difficulties and
  dangers to the goal, yet, as soon as this is reached, it hastens to let the
  curtain fall; for then there remains nothing for it to do but show that the
  glittering goal in which the hero expected to find happiness had only
  disappointed him, and that after its attainment he was no better off than
  before.

  To the point of our discussion on desire: Schopenhauer offers a concrete example

  <blockquote>
  [C]onsider that indefatigable worker the mole; to dig strenuously with its
  enormous shovel-paws is the business of its whole life; permanent night
  surrounds it; it has its embryo eyes merely to avoid the light. It alone is a
  true <i>animal nocturnum</i>, not cats, owls and bats which see by night. What
  does it attain by this course of life that is full of trouble and devoid of
  pleasure? Nourishment and procreation, that is, only the means for continuing
  and beginning again in the new individual the same melancholy course. In such
  examples it becomes clear that the cares and troubles of life are out of all
  proportion to the yield or profit from it . . . The variety and multiplicity of
  the organizations, the ingenuity of the means by which each is adapted to its
  element and to its prey, here contrast clearly with the absence of any lasting
  final aim. Instead of this, we see only momentary gratification, fleeting
  pleasure conditioned by wants, much and long suffering, constant struggle,
  <i>bellum omnium</i> [war of all against all], everything a hunter and
  everything hunted, pressure, want, need, and anxiety, shrieking and howling,
  and this goes on <i>in saecula saeculorum</i> [forever and ever], or until once
  again the crust of the planet breaks . . . Thus, what are a short postponement
  of death, a small alleviation of need and want, a deferment of pain, a
  momentary satisfaction of desire, with the frequent and certain victory of
  death over them all? Taken as actual causes of movement of the human race, what
  could such advantages achieve? This human race is innumerable through its being
  constantly renewed; it is incessantly astir, pushes, presses, worries,
  struggles, and performs the whole tragi-comedy of world-history . . .
  [E]veryone guards and protects his life like a precious pledge entrusted to him
  under a heavy responsibility, under infinite care and daily necessity; and
  under these life is just tolerable. Naturally, he does not see the why and the
  wherefore, the reward for this, but has accepted the value of that pledge in
  good faith and on trust without looking into it . . . This is the
  <i>will-to-live</i> manifesting itself as an untiring mechanism, as an
  irrational impulse, which does not have its sufficient ground or reason in the
  external world.
  </blockquote>
  What is Schopenhauer's solution to this consuming desire? For all the pessimism
  implied in the phrase "denial of the will-to-live", Schopenhauer's intention in
  doing so was commendable: to return to unity, to renounce individual striving,
  that through self-denial, one negates one's egotism:
  <blockquote>
  Man attains to the state of voluntary renunciation, resignation, true composure,
  and complete will-lessness . . . We would like to deprive desires of their
  sting, close the entry to all suffering, purify and sanctify ourselves by
  complete and final resignation . . . [T]he man who sees through the
  <i>principium individuationis</i> [individuation principle, through which one
  strives against others towards a happiness that once attained will prove to be
  ephemeral and illusory], and recognizes the true nature of
  things-in-themselves, and thus the whole, is no longer susceptible of such
  consolation; he sees himself in all places simultaneously, and withdraws . . .
  The phenomenon by which this becomes manifest is the transition from virtue to
  <i>asceticism</i>.
  </blockquote>

  Now that we've indulged in some Schopenhauer, I wish to qualify his claims.
  Schopenhauer says no happiness lasts; this is true, but it doesn't take much
  work to acquire small moments of happiness which suffice to get through the
  days. In reality, most people aren't plagued by the endless struggle and
  fruitless labor Schopenhauer suggested but are rather content. This
  observation, though, is rather on point and worth emphasizing, to disabuse
  ourselves of some attainable state of permanent peace and rest: happiness from
  any single attainment does not endure and requires continual replenishment by
  further appetite and more work: this is mankind's relation to happiness. Yet
  this serial struggle doesn't present so immense a problem unless one pursues
  the extremes of happiness to the point of avarice, gluttony, excess. In most
  folks, this is not the case. Yet how should one respond to these confinements
  of our condition? My stance is that if there is any truth in Schopenhauer, it
  ought to be confronted and answered, both theoretically and practically. From
  one vantage, the Nietzschean: the positive affirmation of life. Yet considering
  the variety of philosophical perspectives and broad range of human
  circumstances, it is not my place to issue some unilateral decree of piety and
  correctness. However, I doubt any stance on non-desire, self-denial, and
  renunciation will acquire any substantial traction among any country's
  populace. Schopenhauer himself was a hypocrite and didn't conform to his own
  philosophy; having been born into wealth and then inheriting that wealth when
  he was young, Schopenhauer never quite did renounce life so much as avail
  himself to worldly pleasures. The harsh asceticism he proposes, then, loses
  practical credibility. As a consequence, we must assume that the due course of
  action is to admit to desire, and that out of that desire, people will endeavor
  and labor, a factor contributing to social inequality. This is our view on
  human desire: people should be free to endeavor and labor towards their aspired
  goals, the objects of their desire, and on the whole this is not harmful; yet,
  as I discuss later in the social capitalism section, this same motivation at
  extreme concentrations of wealth depraves society into vanity, privation, and
  endlessly unsatisfied appetites.

  <blockquote>
  Savage man and civilized man differ so much at the bottom of their hearts and in
  their inclinations, that what constitutes the supreme happiness of the one
  would reduce the other to despair. The first sighs for nothing but repose and
  liberty; he desires only to live, and to be exempt from labor . . . Civilized
  man, on the other hand, is always in motion, perpetually sweating and toiling,
  and racking his brains to find out occupations still more laborious: he
  continues a drudge to his last minute; nay, he courts death to be able to live,
  or renounces life to acquire immortality.

<u id="import-of-work">Import of Work</u><br>

  We emphasize in this section the crucial significance of working. That's
  right—working itself confers benefits. Charles Duhigg, in a 2019
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/elite-professionals-jobs-happiness.html">article</a>
  in The New York Times Magazine, writes on the importance of work:
  <blockquote>
  Even for Americans who live frighteningly close to the bone . . . a job is
  usually more than just a means to a paycheck. It's a source of purpose and
  meaning, a place in the world.
  </blockquote>
  He cites a study on janitors about why some enjoyed their jobs much more than
  others—they placed more meaning in their work, seeing it as impactful and
  helpful, sometimes even putting in an effort beyond their job's duties. Duhigg
  provides this example to highlight the significance of meaningfulness for job
  satisfaction, but Duhigg's article concerns the same issue as Brueggemann's
  book: on how the wealthy and successful nevertheless often feel miserable about
  their jobs. Duhigg writes of a former classmate who became an investor:
  <blockquote>
  He earned about $1.2 million a year and hated going to the office. "I feel like
  I'm wasting my life," he told me. "When I die, is anyone going to care that I
  earned an extra percentage point of return? My work feels totally
  meaningless."
  </blockquote>
  Clay Cockrell, a therapist to ultra-high net worth individuals,
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/22/therapist-super-rich-succession-billionaires">shares</a>
  in The Guardian the trouble with his clients' absence of purpose, their sense of
  a lack of impact, even irrelevance:
  <blockquote>
  Why bother going to work when the business you have built or inherited runs
  itself without you now? If all your necessities and much more were covered for
  the rest of your life – you might struggle with a lack of meaning and ambition
  too. My clients are often bored with life and too many times this leads to them
  chasing the next high – chemically or otherwise – to fill that void.
  </blockquote>
  What they lack is meaningful work. Thoreau writes in his JOURNAL:
  <blockquote>
  To be a man is to do a man's work; always our resource is to endeavor. We may
  well say, Success to our endeavors. Effort is the prerogative of virtue. The
  true laborer is recompensed by his labor, not by his employer. Industry is its
  own wages. Let us not suffer our hands to lose one jot of their handiness by
  looking behind to a mean recompense, knowing that our true endeavor cannot be
  thwarted, nor we be cheated of our earnings unless by not earning them.
  </blockquote>
  David Hume observes in his essay, OF REFINEMENT IN THE ARTS:
  <blockquote>
  Indolence or repose, indeed, seems not of itself to contribute much to our
  enjoyment; but, like sleep, is requisite as an indulgence to the weakness of
  human nature, which cannot support an uninterrupted course of business or
  pleasure. In times when industry and the arts flourish, men are kept in
  perpetual occupation, and enjoy, as their reward, the occupation itself, as
  well as those pleasures which are the fruit of their labour. The mind acquires
  new vigour; enlarges its powers and faculties; and by an assiduity in honesty
  industry, both satisfies its natural appetites, and prevents the growth of
  unnatural ones, which commonly spring up, when nourished by ease and
  idleness . . . When sloth reigns, a mean uncultivated way of life prevails
  amongst individuals, without society, without enjoyment.
  </blockquote>
  Further back: Aristotle, too, discouraged passivity, believing in the vigor
  of work and activity. Aristotle writes in NICOMACHEAN ETHICS:
  <blockquote>
  [W]e must rather class happiness as an activity . . . Happiness, therefore, does
  not lie in amusement; it would, indeed, be strange if the end were amusement,
  and one were to take trouble and suffer hardship all one's life in order to
  amuse oneself . . . The happy life is thought to be virtuous; now a virtuous
  life requires exertion, and does not consist in amusement. And we say that
  serious things are better than laughable things and those connected with
  amusement . . . That this activity is contemplative we have already said.
  </blockquote>
  In Aristotle's case, man's ideal activity is intellectual. Aristotle reasoned
  that each creature has its strengths and ability and, from these, their proper
  and suitable pleasures; for man, it is reason and contemplation:
  <blockquote>
  If reason is divine, then, in comparison with man, the life according to it is
  divine in comparison with human life. But we must not follow those who advise
  us, being men, to think of human things, and, being mortal, of mortal things,
  but must, so far as we can, make ourselves immortal, and strain every nerve to
  live in accordance with the best thing in us . . . [F]or man, therefore the
  life according to reason is best and pleasantest, since reason more than
  anything else is man. This life therefore is also the happiest.
  </blockquote>
  But mindful of the reader's concerns about the practical matter of being human,
  embodied in a physical form needing material sustenance, Aristotle writes:
  <blockquote>
  [B]eing a man, one will also need external prospertiy; for our nature is not
  self-sufficient for the purpose of contemplation, but our body also must be
  healthy and must have food and other attention. Still, we must not think that
  the man who is to be happy will need many things or great things, merely
  because he cannot be supremely happy without external goods; for
  self-sufficiency and action do not involve excess, and we can do noble acts
  without ruling earth and sea.
  </blockquote>
  So convinced of this divine aspiration, Aristotle proclaims: "[F]or the life of
  the man who is active in accordance with virtue will be happy." But this
  extreme of pursuit runs up against the troubles observed by Rousseau as
  excessive refinement and indulgent surfaces concealing vanity and
  self-interest. Although Aristotle advocated moderation in all pursuits and
  pleasures, he was uninhibited when it came to endorsing the contemplative life,
  the thinking philospher—and we see that, brought to an extreme, this activity
  is not as Aristotle described, as virtuous pursuit and self-sufficient
  happiness, but as endless, destructive striving: the Schopenhauerian. An
  updated, realistic Aristotelian happiness may rather be: simple living, simple
  thinking—modesty in all things, even contemplation.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  If from all this [series of fruitless desires], which with ordinary degrees of
  willing is felt only in a smaller measure, and produces only the ordinary
  degree of dejection, there necessarily arise an excessive inner torment, an
  eternal unrest, an incurable pain in the case of a person who is the phenomenon
  of the will reaching to extreme wickedness.
  </blockquote>

  <br>

  Moderation in all endeavors may well be a noble aspiration, but we are concerned
  less with facades and public preaching, less with virtue signaling and
  conformist principles, less with lofty words that we promote but do not
  ourselves enact, less with inhibitions and guilt and hypocrisy, and ask
  directly: what do we want out of life? How do we reconcile moderation with our
  corrupt impulses, our mortal preoccupations, our base self-interest? One
  desires and wishes, one longs and searches, one travails and attains, yet we
  find no contentment or satisfaction, all our effort and struggle gone in vain,
  the grass on the other side always greener. How should we resolve this dilemma,
  then? I ask: what if this is not a binary choice between wanting and its
  negation? Let us suggest an alternative approach: instead of choosing one to
  the exclusion of the other, what if we assert that we desire everything? What
  if we acknowledge that we can here engage in frenzy and energy and there
  partake in peace and serenity? What if we accept our fickle human nature and
  embrace our myriad cravings? What if we desire to be everywhere at the same
  time? The food, the people, the journey, the intellectual sublime, the musical
  variations, the cathartic sways, the scorching fire and excitement, the roaring
  seas on the high tide, and then desert, camel, the still sand; people come and
  go as do we, but for a time a wanderer can blend in with the multi-generational
  locals of a remote town, to return to the bustling crowds of sensory
  multitudes, culture, coincidence. What if fulfillment lies not in stillness
  with any one choice but in a continual movement through all choices?

<u id="second-field">Second Field</u><br>

  Another view of the field. In the field, everyone both perceives and signals.
  Each operation has two modes. Let us suppose each group* has two people.

  *A group is a category of people by a measure of similarity: race, gender,
   geography, religion, age, interests, traits, abilities. Any grouping may be
   further subdivided into subgroups based on the remaining measures, and the
   subgroups as well in turn. However, we prefer no particular order of
   group-subgroup nesting, and so we may select different group arrangements.
   Each grouping order realigns people into separate partitions, and no person
   remains in a fixed position. In this example, for simplicity, we use only a
   single level of grouping.

  <br>

  <pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">

  B /|\ --------------------------> /|\
    / \          individual         / \

  -group is easy and convenient and is the default mode
  -individual costs more time and attention; this mode is limited because no one
   can get to know everyone, much less adequately
  -these two modes are not mutually exclusive; everyone perceives in both modes
   towards different people, even towards the same person (e.g. individual
   perception as confirming or defying the group perception)
  -in the diagram, only out-arrows from A and B are shown but in the field,
   out-arrows are present between all to all; A and B are themselves perceived by
   others, too. Because this diagram is limited, consisting in only three groups,
   each with two people, it is possible to draw out-arrows between every pair,
   but in the field of life, out-arrows exist only between people who come into a
   shared physical vicinity or through some medium (book, painting, video, audio
   recording), in both the present and the past, between people with enduring
   relations and people who come and go




  <u>Signaling</u>: projecting one's window to one's conception of others' windows

  -here, a pertinent grouping is political ideology


  We make a few observations about perceiving and signaling:
  -perceiving and signaling are both functions of information transmission, of
   communication, subject to the lossy nature of communication and the
   misdirection by self-interested parties, both benign and malicious
  -the transmitted image constitutes a separate layer from the actual person.
   Neither image perceived nor impression signaled needs to match the actual
  -perceiving and signaling are not innocent from one's self-interest. Perception
   is limited by time and attention, and tends to be directed towards enhancing
   one's self-image or serving one's desires. Signaling, likewise, projects an
   inflated, self-flattering impression
  -what someone's window perceives of another is a combination of the other's
   signaling and actual, whose proportions depend on the type of interaction. The
   more extended, varied, and numerous the interactions, the more opportunities
   for one's window to perceive the actual. In the absence of any meaningful
   interaction, what one perceives of the other is not the actual but is the
   obstructing painting made of colors and forms derived solely from the
   perceiver's own room: prior experiences, general knowledge, prejudice,
   self-interest; what one sees are the appearances one obtains from limited
   experience and inadequate knowledge
  -not shown is another arrow: the self-reflexive. In this case, one perceives
   one's own signaling, which is an impression that may be different from one's
   outward signaling. The diagrams show perceiving and signaling as they relate
   to grouping, but the functions apply in the general scenario of relations
   between people
  -if relations in the field are conducted along these channels, there arise
   further questions: how much can one know of others? how much can one know of
   oneself?

  his qualities as a human individual . . . I learned within a very few hours
  that no one was judging me by my qualities as a human individual and everyone
  was judging me by my pigment. As soon as white men or women saw me, they
  automatically assumed I possessed a whole set of false characteristics . . .
  They could not see me or any other black man as a human individual because they
  buried us under the garbage of their stereotyped view of us . . . Always, in

  percent of all rural residents earn their primary living from farming . . . I
  urge further critical examination of the apparent ease with which both

  Fundamentally the persona is nothing real: it is a compromise between

<span id="Walking-through-Walmart.Learning to not desire"></span>
  I was recently walking through Walmart when I stumbled upon the book aisle. I
  was surprised because I didn't know they had such an aisle, but it's tucked
  away in the back. I walked through, and one book on the top shelf caught my
  eye. It was the green book, THE GIVING TREE, which I hadn't read since it came
  out as I was entering my luminous fourth decade. It was the copy with the
  author Shel Silverstein's handsome face at the back. I suppose he was trying to
  mimic my facial expression that stuck out to him in his photographic memory
  after we met, and how successful he was! Studies show that flashing that
  particular kind of friendly smile is guaranteed to keep the children coming
  back, scientifically proven with 98% accuracy! Like the tree in the book, I
  give generously. Surely, had they flipped the book around so that the back
  cover were on display, I would have detected the book aisle as soon as my right
  foot placed itself upon the grounds of the store, whereupon I'd have made a
  straight beeline, hopping over merchandise racks and fences and trenches and
  definitely over the land mines to catch a glimpse of what my once-facial
  expression had inspired. I admire that photo as if it were my own face, so vain
  am I, only one connection removed. Well, there was actually one occasion when I
  was almost photographed. My birth year is closer in time to the Civil War than
  the Great Depression; don't get me started on how many struggles I've seen in
  my lifetime or about being drafted twice, but Dorothea Lange almost caught me
  in a photo because when she snapped MIGRANT MOTHER, I was sitting just nearby.
  But there I was in the hidden aisle, reading THE GIVING TREE, face-palming
  Silverstein's face. I had every intention of purchasing the book, but I must
  have underestimated my powers because my casual perusal ended up finishing the
  book—how proud I was that my reading abilities could handle a children's book!
  If I were being truthful, I would say there Kevin was in the aisle, flipping
  through a book, when he turned and saw some real competition: browsing the
  books too were a mother and her toddler daughter sitting in a cart! The thought
  occurred to him: who can finish the book faster? Yet while he read, he quickly
  lost himself in the pages, recalling with the mixture of distant memory and
  interceding life experience all the details of the story, how the young boy at
  first was happy playing on the tree's branches, then as he grew older how he
  successively took away apples, branches, and finally the whole trunk, until one
  day the tree was no more than a stump. The boy wanted more and more things,
  never content nor happy, until the end when as an elderly man he returned to
  the stump for company, not wanting anything more.

  Man is born with needs, and he creates needs for himself. The first class

  shown that at the outset men had scarcely anything but natural needs, seeking
  only to live; but in proportion as life's pleasures have become more numerous,
  they have become habits. These in turn have finally become almost as necessary
  as life itself . . . The more prosperous a society is, the more diversified and
  more durable become the enjoyments of the greatest number, the more they
  simulate true necessity through habit and imitation. Civilised man is therefore
  infinitely more exposed to the vicissitudes of destiny than savage man . . .
  Along with the range of his pleasures he has expanded the range of his needs
  and leaves himself more open to the hazard of fortune . . . Among very
  civilised peoples, the lack of a multitude of things causes poverty; in the
  savage state, poverty consists only in not finding something to eat . . . If
  all these reflections are correct it is easy to see that the richer a nation
  is, the more the number of those who appeal to public charity must multiply,
  since two very powerful causes tend to that result. On the one hand, among
  these nations, the most insecure class continuously grows. On the other hand,
  needs infinitely expand and diversify, and the chance of being exposed to some
  of them becomes more frequent each day.

  We consider here the country's present state of inequality and then reason
  towards a more sustainable economic form. Let us consider the current landscape
  of wealth ownership in the country. Based on the total population
  <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/2020-population-and-housing-state-data.html">count</a>
  from the 2020 census and the total net worth
  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1kDFV">data</a>
  segmented by percentile grouping (the top 1%, because of extreme internal wealth
  disparity, is additionally partitioned into the top 0.1% and the remainder of
  the 1%. Their total net worths are displayed in the dotted lines) from the
  Federal Reserve, we compute the per capita net worth for each percentile
  segment.

  <pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
                2020 population  Q4 2023 Group Net Worth  Per Capita Net Worth

  Inequality is apparent, but I don't think inequality itself is the culprit
  behind the country's mounting tensions; rather it is the extent of the
  inequality. Using the Fed's data reaching back to 1990, we can view the rising
  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1qzq5">inequality</a>
  using the same metric of per capita net worth per percentile group. We note that
  the 1% in general has done well, but it is specifically the 0.1% that has
  eclipsed everyone else. (Note to those readers who observe that the per capita
  net worth numbers from the Fed data don't match the ones in my table above:
  what keen and pedantic eyes. For the sake of simplicity, I relied on the
  Census' 2020 population count, not the updated one the Fed uses; in addition, I
  wanted to provide a recent estimate on the country's financial distribution at
  the end of 2023—my table's per capita net worth numbers are higher than the
  Fed's 2020 and 2023 numbers because my calculation used the lower 2020
  population and the higher 2023 net worths. However, the overall trend of
  inequality remains the same.)

  Conceptually, for the sole purpose of illustration, using the numbers from the
  table above, if we suppose the entirety of the net worths of the wealthiest
  were redistributed to the whole population, barring every difficulty, legally
  and logistically, in this exercise bypassing all laws of private property,
  somehow suspending stock market valuations in spite of wholesale dumping
  without purchasers on the other end, this magical selling applying also to real
  estate, land, boats, and paintings, and throughout this process suspending all
  taxation, we can see the scale of such a redistribution. These proceeds would
  go to every person:

  <pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
  Redistribute net worth of top  1%: $133,809
  Redistribute net worth of top 10%: $295,711
  </pre>

  These are considerable sums, but not quite enough on their own to fund
  retirement. Such a scheme, however, seems to me quite undesirable, and among
  the many conceivable reasons is the foremost: a sudden cash infusion into the
  economy will likely have similar inflationary effects as the three stimulus
  plans enacted during the pandemic, even if the last of which was admirably
  called the American Rescue Plan Act. These plans offered cash aid in the
  thousands of dollars, as the Pandemic Response Committee has
  <a href="https://www.pandemicoversight.gov/data-interactive-tools/data-stories/update-three-rounds-stimulus-checks-see-how-many-went-out-and">documented</a>,
  in three rounds, at $1,200, $600, and $1,400, per person. Considering how
  extensively the Fed has had to, in the aftermath,
  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1kEuT">sustain</a>
  a higher federal funds rate to combat the inflation caused by these thousands,
  it would be appalling to imagine how either of the above redistribution
  scenarios, with payouts greater by two orders of magnitude, in full or
  staggered, will affect the economy. Alternatively, the funds could be
  redirected towards infrastructure projects, public works, and sustainable
  energy. However, it is not the writer's place to suggest a realistic
  redistribution scheme. Nevertheless, we insist on emphasizing the extent of
  economic inequality.

  A 2015
  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/98ce14ee-99a6-11e5-95c7-d47aa298f769">article</a>
  in the Financial Times reported the decline of the middle class since 1971 and
  the expansion of the poorest and wealthiest ends. The Economic Policy Institute
  published an
  <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/">article</a>
  in 2015 on wage stagnation, noting a stark trend since 1973 on a growing gap
  between productivity and wages. From 1947 to 1973, productivity (up 96.7%) was
  nearly identical to hourly compensation (up 91.3%), but from 1973 to 2013,
  productivity (up 74.4%) continued to grow but this growth diverged from a
  nearly stagnant hourly compenstation (up 9.2%), and the EPI attributes the
  divergence between economic productivity and wages to the staggering growth in
  the compensation of CEOs at large companies. And in 2018, the Pew Resarch
  Center released similar
  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/">findings</a>,
  noting that from 1964 to 2018, average hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, did
  not grow meaningfully, that "today's real average wage . . . has about the same
  purchasing power it did 40 years ago." The article doesn't have data on CEO
  compensation, but its data does indicate, although on a shorter time horizon,
  that most of the wage gains between 2000 and 2018 have gone to the top earners
  at the 90th percentile. From another angle, with the Fed's data on
  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1kEms">income (before taxes) by quintile</a>
  since 1984: economic output measured through GDP per capita has steadily risen,
  yet the income (before tax) of the top 20% has continued to distance itself
  from everyone else's. (More of the Fed's data that may be of interest:
  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1kEn0">income by decile</a>,
  more granular, although on a shorter time scale, from 2014 to 2022. And
  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1kEnB">income by education</a>)
  Simultaneously, a distinct and continuing rise in
  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1kEoj">corporate profits</a>
  started around 1990, unabated by federal tax collection, which has remained
  relatively flat compared to the soaring profits, leading to the growing power
  of corporations.

  How have the corporate tax rates faltered? We consult their historical brackets:
  the IRS
  <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/02corate.pdf">documents</a>
  them from 1909 to 2002, with the Tax Foundation
  <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/historical-corporate-tax-rates-brackets/">supplying</a>
  another complete listing that runs up to 2020. We observe that a dramatic shift
  towards more lenient taxes at the higher end began in 1984, when more brackets
  were created towards the top and the highest bracket rose to $1,405,000, up
  from $100,000 in 1983, although the rates for the new dollar-equivalent
  brackets remained either similar or identical to the old 46%. Very quickly,
  though, starting in 1987, the rates started declining, as the top rate fell to
  40%, with the next lower rungs following suit. Another dip came in 1988, with
  the top rate falling to 34%. Fast forward to today: since 2018, thanks to
  Trump's Tax Cut and Jobs Act—which flattened the progressive rate structure
  introduced in 1936 during the New Deal, with higher rates applying towards
  higher income brackets—one single corporate income bracket stands at 21%.

  similar corrosive effects of the lower taxes on inequality:
  <blockquote>
  In 2018, the US tax system looks like a giant flat tax that becomes regressive
  at the very top end. The working class and the middle class pay substantial
  taxes because payroll taxes are large and state and local sales and excise
  taxes are regressive. The very top pays low effective tax rates because of the
  demise of the federal corporate tax, which in 2018 collected only 1.5 percent
  of national income, down from 5–7 percent in the 1950s. The effective
  individual income tax rate falls at the top end because the very rich earn
  income through corporations and can avoid reporting individual income.

  With several decades of decline in taxes on high corporate income, some
  practical ramifications of the power of the expanding corporations:
  <a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/people/daniel-bessner/">David Bessner</a>
  wrote in this year's May issue of Harper's Magazine an
  <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2024/05/the-life-and-death-of-hollywood-daniel-bessner/">article</a>
  about growing corporate control in the film and television industries, with
  major studios merging and then themselves being bought by asset-management
  firms, explaining that the relatively recent proliferation of intellectual
  property like the Marvel Universe is a result of these films' appeal for lower
  risk and securing the bottom line. Another recent

  by
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/jerry-useem/">Jerry Useem</a>
  in The Atlantic, elaborates on how the corporate shift has also occurred at
  Boeing, which in its concern for the bottom line has been outsourcing
  manufacturing to other companies, including another American company, Spirit
  AeroSystems, that constructed the aircraft on January's Alaska Airline Flight
  1282 in which a door plug blew out soon after takeoff. The writer needs to
  mention that he takes no issue with economic growth or corporate profit when
  they are fairly taxed and social conditions remain equitable, but it is
  troubling to witness the decades of largely unchecked corporate gains and the
  rise of corporate preoccupation with profits at the cost of societal
  stability.

  Let us take a step back and consider the broader view: although the wealthiest
  in the country who have benefited in the past few decades certainly play a part
  in this troubling inequality, the less fortunate compose the remaining part the
  struggle. In fact, the elite-mass model is not sufficient to capture the many
  interactions on the stage of human relations, for conflict is not restricted to
  tensions between classes—conflict also permeates within each class. The most
  disadvantaged and disenchanted struggle among themselves for scraps, the
  middle-classes wrangle with each other to reach greater comforts and status,
  the wealthy compete among themselves to reign above others and for further
  reassurance of their exclusivity. This is <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>,
  the war of all against all. Voltaire reflects in CANDIDE:
  <blockquote>
  I own to you that when I cast an eye on this globe, or rather on this little
  ball, I cannot help thinking that God has abandoned it to some malignant being.
  I except, always, El Dorado. I scarcely ever knew a city that did not desire
  the destruction of a neighbouring city, nor a family that did not wish to
  exterminate some other family. Everywhere the weak execrate the powerful,
  before whom they cringe; and the powerful beat them like sheep whose wool and
  flesh they sell. A million regimented assassins, from one extremity of Europe
  to the other, get their bread by disciplined depredation and murder, for want
  of more honest employment. Even in those cities which seem to enjoy peace, and
  where the arts flourish, the inhabitants are devoured by more envy, care, and
  uneasiness than are experienced by a besieged town.
  </blockquote>

  We take the view that a society's economic prosperity is reflected not through
  wealth measured in absolute terms, but as a relative between the poorest and
  the richest. That one's well-being and prosperity are gauged relatively to
  those of others, that one's sense of satisfaction is not anchored on fixed
  ground, that the instruction manual cannot prescribe an endeavor towards an
  unchanging goalpost after whose attainment one is content and assured, because
  desires are constantly shifting, the further others pull ahead the more one
  must strive to keep pace—the whole procession of this mutual evaluation
  characterizes the social nature of appetites, demands, necessities, which in
  civilized society are not so much as formed on absolute terms as on relative
  comparison. How could someone complain over a lukewarm meal if all anyone knows
  is meager rations? In the absence of excess and indulgence, how can someone
  complain about lacking what others do not have? How can someone contrive
  urgency and desperate need when no one glosses luxuries, vanities, and false
  promises, all generated under tumultuous noise and gushing coloration, every
  party incentivized by profit, flattery, and imagined triumph? What is social is
  necessarily relative; each member of society dangles in a web sprouting
  outwards in multiple directions, and each is a perch assessing relative
  position.

  Back in 2007, politically sedate compared to today,
  <a href="https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/rhf3/">Robert H. Frank</a>
  noticed the income and wealth inequalities of the prior few decades and writes
  in his book, FALLING BEHIND, that in addition to the material privation, those
  who have been left without incur a psychological toll along with its material
  consequences:
  <blockquote>
  Experiments have shown . . . that happiness levels differ substantially
  according to who happens to be in the room when the question is posed. Subjects
  rate their own happiness levels about two points higher on a ten-point scale if
  someone in a wheelchair is present during the survey . . . An adolescent in
  Adam Smith's eighteen-century Scotland would not have been much embarrassed by
  having a slight overbite, because not even the wealthiest members of society
  wore braces on their teeth then. In the intervening years, however, rising
  living standards have altered the frame of reference that defines an acceptable
  standard of cosmetic dentistry . . . Increased spending at the top of the
  income distribution has imposed not only psychological costs on families in the
  middle, but also more tangible costs. In particular, it has raised the cost of
  achieving goals that most middle-class families regard as basic. Consider, for
  example, the price a middle-class family must pay in order to secure housing
  that is adequate by community standards. Increased expenditures on housing by
  top earners resulted in increasing housing expenditures even among those whose
  incomes have not risen . . . With real incomes little higher than they were
  three decades ago, how are middle-class families able to spend so much more
  than they used to on houses, cars, watches, interview suits, and gifts? The
  answer, it turns out, is that they are working every possible angle
  </blockquote>
  which includes working longer hours, shrinking savings, larger debts, and longer
  commutes to work from more affordable neighborhoods.

  The wealthiest cadre, accustomed to every comfort, possessing many freedoms,
  nevertheless bored and restless, push on to newer frontiers, but each advance
  lays behind it another step for the less fortunate, admiring and envying at a
  distance, already subject to a lifetime's ordeal of toil and industry, to
  overcome. The appearance of satisfaction from these comforts in spite of no
  real satiety is sufficient to open a further gap between the classes. The
  wealthy indulge in another desire and another appetite and create another
  necessity, and those left without must endure yet another relative privation.
  The greater the distance between the wealthy and the poor, the more
  dissatisfied, disgruntled, disenfranchised vast numbers in society become over
  what are for them unattainable desires, unaffordable cravings, manufactured and
  marketed, and inequality amplified and sustained generates societal
  instability. Through the introduction of the social web, what to an individual
  was formerly absolute affluence, gratification, and delight transmogrifies into
  relative impoverishment, trouble, unending worry, irritation, malaise,
  bottomless hunger.

  Viewed as a relative, the well-being of individuals in a civilized society
  cannot be secured as a stationary collective of wellness acquisitions in the
  form of some definite income or wealth threshold, home ownership, academic
  credential, or professional occupation, but as a highly variable standing
  within an ever-shifting field of innumerable parties with competing interests.
  The relative nature of the social enterprise implies that the pursuit of
  happiness is a ceaseless endeavor, and no matter the extent of technological
  cultivation, regardless of the satisfaction of actual needs, in every age, men,
  women, and those in between perceive their joy and contentment through a social
  lens directed at the exhibitions and displays of everyone else, and it is the
  fate of the civilized to continuously compete and strive. Although this social
  arena is certainly composed of perceiving signals, as each competitor
  necessarily perceives others, and while it is true that signaling here retains
  its lossy scope and susceptibility to misdirection, it is a mistake to take a
  perspectival view and hold the misguided stance that materiality no longer
  matters: the dynamics of relative comparison and the whole premise of
  perceiving and signaling as a means to serve one's interests indicate that
  materialism is the principal mode of evaluation by which each contender sizes
  oneself up against others—there cannot be post-materialism because materialism
  is all there is.

  Given the workings of this social fabric, ensnared by this social web, caught
  between hunger and appetite, driven from itch to urge, seduced by the web's
  refined needs and artificial enthusiasms, enamored by thrill and captivated by
  fascination, pressed from stimulant to shock, cursed by the presence of
  resplendent others, swinging through the electrifying to the frenzifying,
  baited by social envy and lured into social boasting, tugged and nagged and
  pricked in a web of incessant sociality of all against all, what a fate for the
  unfortunate lad born into this miserable social affair! How can this wee
  innocent navigate between one temptation and another advertisement promising
  deliverance and ecstasy, igniting the senses from all directions, rousing
  depths of rabid desire, and setting ablaze a great longing which threatens to
  burst forth from within?

  Precisely, how to mitigate the material disparity between groups? While it must
  be permitted that nothing motivates man and woman more than self-interest, that
  they will risk and push and advance only in view of their reward and pride, is
  it also possible within such a society to prevent a general mood of merciless
  competition, a backdrop of many needs and little satisfaction? People being
  capable of both comaraderie and destruction, we ask: what are the societal
  conditions which permit people to pursue feasible happiness and prosper in a
  community rather than hoard resources and fortify their defenses against
  others? What social and economic conditions balance the scales to mitigate
  jealousy, envy, avarice, resentment, in favor of trust, contentment, stability,
  where community relations are healthy and sustainable? Within the natural
  configuration of economic inequality, what mechanisms permit the semblance of
  social equality so that the underlying inequality does not violate democratic
  principles? We answer by affirming the position of social capitalism, a system
  which grants individuals the freedom to grow and pursue their desires but which
  restrains the distance between least privileged and the most by governmental
  intervention at the extremities by heavy taxation at the very top for
  redistribution. We take an adversarial view towards human desire at the
  uninhibited extreme, that although desire should be given priority for
  individual liberty, it is also a force to be tamed and controlled. As Thomas
  Hobbes observed of human desire in LEVIATHAN:
  <blockquote>
  So that in the first place, I put for a generall inclination of all mankind, a
  perpetuall and restlesse desire of Power after power, that ceaseth onely in
  Death. And the cause of this, is not alwayes that a man hopes for a more
  intensive delight, than he has already attained to; or that he cannot be
  content with a moderate power: but because he cannot assure the power and means
  to live well, which he hath present, without the acquisition of more. And from
  hence it is, that Kings, whose power is greatest, turn their endeavours to the
  assuring it a home by Lawes, or abroad by Wars: and when that is done, there
  succeedeth a new desire; in some, of Fame from new Conquest; in others, of ease
  and sensuall pleasure; in others, of admiration, or being flattered for
  excellence in some art, or other ability of the mind.
  </blockquote>
  It must be noted, however, that we are not defending a welfare system which
  demotivates those able-bodied yet unemployed to live off the state's aid
  indefinitely. Just as unrestrained desire which seeks continually in vain to
  sate itself is harmful both to the person and others, so is the absence of
  desire, of helplessness and reliance on state aid, of lethargy and apathy. The
  hazardous potential of the unproductive ought to be kept in mind, but a
  solution to the country's inequality cannot stem primarily from further
  depriving the least privileged. Providing schooling, job training, and
  opportunities is possible only with resources, and motivating the underserved
  must begin with investing in their functioning relation to the economy. In the
  broad scheme, it is the wealthy that concentrates economic power in their own
  reserves.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  The transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes by will,
  inheritance, or gift is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the
  American people. The desire to provide security for oneself and one's family is
  natural and wholesome, but it is adequately served by a reasonable inheritance.
  Great accumulations of wealth cannot be justified on the basis of personal and
  family security. In the last analysis such accumulations amount to the
  perpetuation of great and undesirable concentration of control in a relatively
  few individuals over the employment and welfare of many, many others . . .
  Social unrest and a deepening sense of unfairness are dangers to our national
  life which we must minimize by rigorous methods.

  <br>

  More explicitly, in our stance on social captalism, we make one core assumption:
  no impulse motivates man more than self-interest. Man, when given unhindered
  access to resources, accumulates to no end, and that, to avoid boredom in spite
  of possessing extreme concentrations of wealth, continually hoards and expends,
  causing suffering to others. We make clear our view that inequality is
  inevitable, as unequal aptitude, ambition, and circumstances manifest in
  differential performance, and man needs to be incentivized by rewards for
  greater contribution. However, under this schema of varied productivity, social
  capitalism provides the redistributive mechanism to reduce the range of the
  ensuing inequality.

  That popular immiseration is an outcome of unhindered greed on part of the rich
  to absorb an ever greater share of the nation's wealth is clear from our
  assumption.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  Those who are devoid of discrimination and fail to distinguish between real and
  unreal, the fleeting and the permanent, set their hearts on the changeable
  things of this world; hence they entangle themselves in the net of insatiable
  desire, which leads inevitably to disappointment and suffering. To such, death
  must seem a reality because they identify themselves with that which is born
  and which dies. But the wise, who see deeper into the nature of things, are no
  longer deluded by the charm of the phenomenal world and do not seek for
  permanent happiness among its passing enjoyments.

  Furthermore, from the vantage of state stability, if we follow the consequences
  of Turchin's interpretation of societal conflicts over history, and supposing
  that natural talent and ability is evenly distributed throughout the
  population, across urban and rural geographies, across race and class, we don't
  want everyone pursuing opportunities towards the elite strata; in fact, a
  healthy society requires that many gifted and talented youth voluntarily choose
  careers that reward them less than their potential. This restraint reduces the
  pool of elite aspirants, mitigating the pressures of elite overproduction. I am
  against the hypothetical utopia where everyone with ability should be
  encouraged to pursue opportunities suitable to their capacity; reasons abound
  for why youths may not opt into the elite pathway: some may prefer a more
  ordinary and peaceful lifestyle, a fraction may balk at the decades of
  meritocratic endeavor, others may lack discipline, many are not shown the
  ropes, and the scions of the established elite may renounce the pressures and
  limelight of their parents' position. The point of contention is not education
  itself; I agree with Turchin when he commented in a
  <a href="https://youtu.be/PXXj23UL8zk?t=1101">panel</a>
  on the education part of the problem: "It is not education as we typically
  understand it . . . It's not to educate oneself. It's rather to get the
  credentials that would allow one to compete in the labor market and also to
  enter the ranks of the elites." Towards those liberals who hold a differing
  view on overproduced elites, who harbor sentimental yearning for all children
  to avail themselves to every opportunity, we should remind ourselves of an
  observation from La Rochefoucauld:
  <blockquote>
  Humility is often nothing other than the pretense of submission that one adopts
  in order to undermine others. It is an artifice of pride that debases itself in
  order to elevate itself; and although it can transform itself in a thousand
  ways, it is never better disguised nor more capable of misleading than when it
  is hidden under the guise of humility.
  </blockquote>
  For not a one among them is a sly, self-serving hypocrite. And:
  <blockquote>
  If there are some men who have never appeared ridiculous it is because no one
  ever looked closely.
  </blockquote>
  To those readers who find these words too direct, perhaps the truth can be found
  more palatable when caustic observations are deflected by the thinly veiled
  conceit in Voltaire's CANDIDE:
  <blockquote>
  "Sir, you think doubtless that all is for the best in the moral and physical
  world, and that nothing could be otherwise than it is?"
  <br><br>
  "I, sir!" answered the scholar, "I know nothing of all that; I find that all
  goes awry with me; . . . and that except supper, which is always gay, and
  where there appears to be enough concord, all the rest of the time is passed
  in impertinent quarrels; Jansenist against Molinist, Parliament against the
  Church, men of letters against men of letters, courtesans against courtesans,
  financiers against the people, wives against husbands, relatives against
  relatives—it is eternal war."
  <br><br>
  "I have seen the worst," Candide replied. "But a wise man, who since has had the
  misfortune to be hanged, taught me that all is marvellously well; these are
  but the shadows on a beautiful picture."
  </blockquote>

  Inequality among civilized people in an advanced economy is unavoidable, but
  within social capitalism, the distance between the lowest and highest can be
  shortened. Social capitalism emphasizes moderation in the country's economic
  and social sphere, just as it enables moderation at the individual level.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  The temperate man occupies a middle position with regard to these objects. For
  he neither enjoys the things that the self-indulgent man enjoys most—but rather
  dislikes them—nor in general the things he should not, nor anything of this
  sort to excess, nor does he feel pain or craving when they are absent, or does
  so only to a moderate degree, and not more than he should, nor when he should
  not, and so on; but the things that, being pleasant, make for health or for
  good condition, he will desire moderately and as he should, and also other
  pleasant things if they are not hindrances to these ends, or contrary to what
  is noble, or beyond his means. For he who neglects these conditions loves such
  pleasures more than they are worth, but the temperate man is not that sort of
  person, but the sort of person that the right rule prescribes.

  In an economically and socially mobile society, some ascend, and this is the
  side that invariantly receives most of the public's attention, but the fact is
  that some descend. Centuries ago, once-illustrious noble families, on their
  decline, quietly receded and simply faded away, not mentioning their waning
  fortunes. For this reason, I find one writer, Lynn Sterger Strong, particularly
  commendable for her 2019

  in The Guardian about being downwardly mobile and what this entails. What
  further impresses me is that she takes responsiblity for this, and her tone
  conveys the truth without excessive blaming, without false sympathy, without
  dampening sugar coats: this simply happens as a fact of life, and she is
  forthright, grounded, clear in mind in a way that reveals maturity and seeing
  reality as it is. For the most part, she acknowledges that it was due to her
  and her husband's choices that have led to their circumstances; only briefly
  does she mention that part of the reason is the country's fault, of her

  More practically, a social capitalist system requires a strong government with

  Capitalism encourages individual desire and ambition, to strive for one's
  material, social, reputational, intellectual gain proportionate to one's effort
  against one's languor, indolence, and complacency; capitalism conforms to human
  nature in a stratified state, to the will to live, the will to power, to
  perform against everyone else, and in doing so creating value, products,
  economies, growth, flourishing societies. Overlaid on this foundation, the
  social aspect of this capitalism constrains the human desire to accumulate more
  at the expense of others and of oneself, against the blind will for destructive
  aspiration, unsustainable inequality, rogue greed which hoards power,
  privilege, and inheritance. This social redirection inhibits the individual's
  will at the extremes of capitalist affluence in service of the general will.

  <br>

  This social aspect constitutes a constraint; that is, its social nature is not
  positive, but negative—social capitalism is a capitalism deprived of the
  destructive tendencies of extreme greed and the human impulse to accumulate
  privilege, power, and political influence, by either instituting self-serving
  economic policies or passing on preferential human capital in a free,
  meritocratic market to entrench generational exclusivity. The social constraint
  is a guardrail against the destructive slide into unchecked and
  self-reinforcing power, against popular immiseration, against societal
  collapse. Here a Schopenhauerian description is fitting, not in the
  metaphysical sense but explicitly: the blind, insatiable will—not the will to
  live but the will to power, will to greed, will to excess—drives those with
  wealth to hoard privilege with a striving completely out of proportion to the
  rewards.

  The primary issue afflicting the country is not immigration, as painted in the
  Republican narrative, or lack of diversity, as advanced by staunch Democrats,
  but growing economic inequality and class precarity. Immigration and diversity
  are, of course, valid points of contention, and I have examined them in prior
  sections; while they are convenient platforms to assemble political identity,
  they are not the essential culprits for the current polarization: rather, it is
  the increasingly unbridgeable power differential between the elites and the
  masses. The political fracture will not be resolved solely by sealing off the
  border or expanding ethnic and gender representation. The financial elites have
  for decades channeled more and more of the fruits of the nation's economic
  productivity into their own assets, and in concert with this is the
  meritocratic concentration of privilege in academia and the professions,
  hoarding educational opportunity as a vehicle for upward mobility. Yet for
  common folks: wage stagnation, rising costs, degrading living standards, and
  privation relative to the prosperous elites. Behind this accumulation of
  privilege is the recurring central driver of trouble: human desire is
  insatiable and knows no end, and those in power do not voluntarily relinquish
  their advantage. Turchin writes in END TIMES:
  <blockquote>
  The American ruling class today finds itself in the predicament that has
  recurred thousands of times throughout human history. Many common Americans
  have withdrawn their support from the governing elites . . . Large swaths of
  degree holders, frustrated in their quest for elite positions, are breeding
  grounds for counter-elites, who dream of overthrowing the existing regime. Most
  wealth holders are unwilling to sacrifice any personal advantage for the sake
  of preserving the status quo. The technical term for it is 'revolutionary
  situation.' For the ruling class, there are two routes out of a revolutionary
  situation. One leads to their overthrow. The alternative is to adopt a series
  of reforms that will rebalance the social system, reversing the trends of
  popular immiseration and elite overproduction. The American ruling elites did
  it once, a century ago [with the New Deal]. Can they do it again?
  </blockquote>
  This will not be simple; I concur with Daniel Markovits when he makes it overtly
  clear in THE MERITOCRACY TRAP how difficult the task ahead is: "The meritocracy
  trap was constructed over generations and will take generations to
  dismantle . . . Any victory will be long-fought and hard-won." Even while wary
  of the task's difficulty, Markovits remains hopeful that meritocracy and
  generational privilege can eventually be retracted. I appreciate his undeterred
  resolve, but I do not share his rosy vision because such a mission opposes the
  very nature of human desire—depriving people of aspiration and opportunity,
  taking away their avenues to accumulate private wealth, cutting off the natural
  instinct to bequeath skills, connections, positions, and cultural capital to
  their children, and preventing parents from passing on a competitive edge are
  all surefire ways to demotivate a population and hamper innovation. I do not
  imagine that it is possible, even in a hypothetical scenario in which economic
  wealth has been sensibly redistributed, that meritorious parents will refrain
  from grooming their children for advantaged fields in a society that offers
  differential rewards—and it is this exact mechanism, incentivizing quality and
  productivity, that leads to economic prosperity. It is easy to broadcast
  egalitarian ideals and harbor images of true equality among all, but to do as
  we say is a different matter entirely when private interests are concerned.
  Ambition, drive, productivity, and innovation depend on pulsating desire, yet
  it is precisely this desire which simultaneously yields material disparity and
  societal inequality. If it seems impossible to attain absolute equality, it is
  because our subject is corrupt, as human desire continually churns towards
  heights of its own success, aspiring to do better than its neighbors.

  What of lasting happiness, virtue, contentment, free from comparison and
  relative evaluation? Of happiness and satisfaction, I make no claim or
  guarantee, for it seems to me that Schopenhauer's descriptions are accurate,
  and such attainments do not last; they evade one's grasp by their slippery or
  evaporating nature, and no sooner does one acquire that which one has long
  desired than one quickly loses interest, and to regain the spice of life, one
  turns elsewhere to reacquire excitement, the horizon itself, once reached,
  receding further away. The only certainty is the striving itself, human life
  condemned to an unending movement, perpetual desire, bustling activity that
  knows no rest. The recognition of this fickleness of human nature, never
  satisfied, keen on appearances, unable on its own to be content but only in
  comparison to one's lack of contentment or to that of another—this fact should
  not unsettle any more than many other unpleasant inevitabilites.

  It may be asked: is the outlook on human desire, as a perpetually unfulfilled
  drive, this bleak? But I respond: why should this be? The notion of bleak is
  merely an invention of the human mind, and not a very useful one at that. An
  emperor penguin in the Antarctic, waddling over mile upon mile of snow and ice,
  journeying to find food and shelter, to keep warm by huddling with other
  penguins, continually struggling to survive in a freezing wasteland, protective
  of its baby penguins against predators from the sky and predators in the sea,
  limping over vast stretches of frozen terrain, and with nothing else to protect
  itself against the ferocious and unending glacial winds than crowding together
  with fellow penguins in the same wretched circumstance: in the face of this
  continual battering, at every turn another in the cascade of ice, sea, wind,
  and sky, does the penguin labor over such a fruitless question as the purpose
  of all this trouble? In the middle of its march, does it stop to mull over what
  could possibly be the prize at the end of its daily struggles? Does it demand
  refuge in some higher order or grand fantasy it itself has invented? Viewed
  from above, what a breathtaking scene!—all those mountains of snow, those
  soaring precipices of jagged white cliffs, that gleaming reflection off the
  pristine ocean that stretches back to the horizon—against all this, how tiny
  that group of penguins straddling so clumsily over this immense space, how they
  lurch with their tiny feet, how they glide on their bellies, how they stay
  close to others for warmth, how beautiful they seem, several hundred living
  creatures in this inhospitable home of barren ice, how precarious their lives
  are in this desolate landscape as spectacular as it is grim, magisterially
  silent to their cries. In spite of all this, does the penguin derange itself,
  disturb the small moments of beauty, by bewailing its situation? Does it feel
  entitled to some beneficial end, some land of redemption graced by divine
  spirits? Trapped in an identically grueling situation, what could be the
  purpose of meritocrats continually struggling to maintain their position and
  passing on their privileges to the next generation so they can socially
  reproduce their status? Why do frenzied capitalists chasing blind profit create
  myriad desires and mislead the public into thinking such fabricated necessities
  provide any satiety? Why all this comparison and conceit? Why all this roving,
  jostling, all these ordeals and labors and strife to acquire things that never
  quench the thirst? Why the many pomps and excitements and frictions of human
  motions, all sassy and abuzz? So echoes Schopenhauer: "[H]e does not see the
  why and the wherefore, the reward for this, but has accepted the value of that
  pledge in good faith and on trust without looking into it."

<u id="gender-studies">Gender Studies</u><br>

  A very important digression on the matter of the scope and impact of gender
  performance. Gender studies: A Schopenhauerian Approach. "The world is my
  idea"—the great Schopenhauer rightly opened his majestic book with this line.
  Every breath I (they) draw brings me closer to death under masculine hegemony.
  The world suffers and quakes and strives irrationally around the
  thing-in-itself, the imperceivable and incomprehensible unity of
  will—Schopenhauer was right in identifying the will as the central driver of
  the life force, but we gender theorists do him one better: we clarify that the
  will, evil and terrible, residing in the dark, is undeniably masculine: what
  Schopenhauer labored to describe had always been the blind masculine will. All
  creatures are propelled by this vile, unyielding will: the will-to-masc that
  surrounds us all. Only within the confines of our limited cognition of the
  masculine will do the electromagnetic laws, the force of gravity, the fabric of
  reality, exist: they are not the independent thing-in-itself, which itself must
  be a single, dominating will, free of space and free of time, unmoved by cause
  and unhindered by sympathy: the unitary thing-in-itself is the black heart of
  masculine will! All phenomena we perceive, all thoughts we entertain, all
  sensible stimuli, are only objectifications of the will, which within the cage
  of our humanity are mere representations of an insatiable masculinity.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  Such a long, long way we have to go,<br>
  even farther from the stone masks<br>

  It won't be the smile of flowering men,<br>

  or the boys on horseback, with their rude eyes,<br>

  Let us brave gender theorists set forth on the quest of our lives! Danger is its
  name! O waly, waly, the whole phenomenal world being our image, a monolithic
  complex of masculine will, represented in every force and object, we set
  ourselves the risk and adventure to the treacherous lands of the countryside,
  the land of ash and flame whence the masculine will was born and where its lord
  still holds sway; in our preparation, we summon everything we have in our power
  so that we may be adequately equipped to do battle with this nemesis
  orchestrating all which stands against the good in the world. We bring our
  advanced technology, our money and media, our enlightened ideology, a military
  campaign so adequately equipped which yet nevertheless compromises none of our
  smug smiles or our latte-sipping righteousness, and when we come near the
  objective of our mission, when we approach the well-hidden door to their lair,
  we kick it down with such inclusive and diverse force, wearing our hazmat suits
  and witch doctor masks, armed with our firehoses and axepicks, and were we,
  standing at the entrance to the source of all perils corrupting the earth, to
  stop at that very moment before we throw in the smoke balloons and paralyzing
  juice, we may find looks of confusion from regular folks having a drink after
  work. So vested in our suits and armaments, playing the boom box, marching
  under the banner of the rainbow flag, do we hurl the smoker and blinder? We
  look into the eyes of these men and women lounging in this dungeon of malice,
  trying to detect with our telescopic and microscopic and X-ray-scopic
  university-training, what manner of creatures these are. Are they disguises
  like much of everything else, objectifications and representations of the
  masculine will? We stumble on this
  <a href="https://youtu.be/h9lSZlDJAC0?t=2607">scene</a>:
  a discerning viewer will notice the man sitting at the bar. We make the
  astounding realization that he is the father of the patriarchy. No wonder we
  couldn't find him before! He's been hiding out here in Appalachia all along! Or
  could it be that they are just some fine, decent folks living their lives?
  Waving hammer and sickle, parading in the wave of anger, we pause and wonder:
  could this be true? And if they are just ordinary, tax-paying, honest men and
  women minding their business and going about their day in their local
  communities and economies which are, admittedly, quite different from our
  globalized spectacle, do we let them off the hook for being images and
  phenomena of the indomitable masculine will? Or could it be that they are
  regular people? If so, would their very beings morph into pan-phobic machines
  if we see them at a Trump rally? Could it in fact be that they are simple folks
  who don't appreciate lies and hypocrisy, as a certain James, who supports
  Trump, says in this

  to be. But some of these things get so stigmatized. How do I say it?" Craig
  paused. "You should be free to be who you are, but don't stuff it down other

  Though we know that we cannot possibly perceive the black heart of man, we
  understand that the singularity, without space or time, is most discriminatory
  and objectionable. How intolerant! How exclusive! It is one thing to be outside
  of space, but also of time? Though Schopenhauer stopped himself at a radical
  denial of this will, we suggest a new horizon, a new denial through immersion
  in the complete opposite: we venture towards an utmost difficulty: all-space!
  and yet that will not suffice for our battle cry for inclusion! for we must
  also endeavor towards all-time! Rather than the denial instrinsic to the
  will-to-masc, we propose a revolution of nothing less than disruptive pronouns!
  This is no hegemony that lay beyond any human capacity, but rather a movement
  which is the totality of inclusion, an all-encompassing completeness, a
  merciless they-ism! They and them, them and they! By the utter negation of the
  will-to-masc, we become flexible, expressive, truly incredible. We thus come
  full circle in our pan-inclusivity and end where we began: "The world is my
  idea."

  Speaking plainly, I agree that gender is performative, but there is a limit. In
  our present political climate, gender issues loom large and occupy a clamoring
  presence, but academically and intellectually, the premise is rather mundane.
  That a convention is constructed does not immediately imply it is false and
  trifling; as true as gender is constructed and performative, so are
  personalities, cultural inculcations, social conventions, linguistic norms,
  monetary exchange. To reveal that gender is performative is scarcely
  innovative. Beauvoir herself writes of the female role as a social construction
  in THE SECOND SEX:
  <blockquote>
  One is not born, but rather becomes, woman. No biological, psychic, or economic
  destiny defines the figure that the human female takes on in society; it is
  civilization as a whole that elaborates this intermediary product between the
  male and the eunuch that is called feminine. Only the mediation of another can
  constitute an individual as an <i>Other</i>. Inasmuch as he exists for himself,
  the child would not grasp himself as sexually differentiated . . . [I]t must be
  repeated again that within the human collectivity nothing is natural, and
  woman, among others, is a product developed by civilization; the intervention
  of others in her destiny is originary: if this process were driven in another
  way, it would produce a very different result.
  </blockquote>
  Goffman wrote a book called GENDER ADVERTISEMENTS predicated on the messaging,
  displaying, and performing of gender roles. More generally, the observation
  that gender is performed must be situated along a series of discovered social
  constructs: Jung's persona, Goffman's social theatrics, social class in
  Veblen's conspicuous consumption and Brooks' bohemian bourgeois; as a matter of
  fact, culture and cultural socialization are also social constructions, as is
  the exchange of economic labor in a capitalist society. Marx, in CAPITAL,
  describes the social nature of monetary exchange:
  <blockquote>
  The owner of a commodity is prepared to part with it only in return for other
  commodities whose use-value satisfies his own need . . . [H]e desires to
  realize his commodity, as a value, in any other suitable commodity of the same
  value. It does not matter to him whether his own commodity has any use-value
  for the owner of the other commodity or not. From this point of view, exchange
  is for him a general social process . . . We have already seen, from the
  simplest expression of value, <i>x</i> commodity A = <i>y</i> commodity B, that
  the thing in which the magnitude of the value of another thing is represented
  appears to have the equivalent form independently of this relation, as a social
  property inherent in its nature . . . What appears to happen is not that a
  particular commodity becomes money because all other commodities express their
  values in it, but, on the contrary, that all other commodities universally
  express their values in a particular commodity because it is money [which forms
  the inherent social property] . . . Men are henceforth related to each other
  in their social process of production in a purely atomistic way. Their own
  relations of production therefore assume a material shape which is independent
  of their control and their conscious individual action.
  </blockquote>
  It may even be said that no form of interpersonal relation is not a performance,
  a dance of perceiving and signaling which hardly abide by the factual person.
  Further, it may be proposed that no one can be genuinely themselves in a social
  field, and that one can with immense difficulty know only degrees of oneself,
  and in doing so exert great effort in vain to pry oneself free from social
  constructs. Man and woman are social creatures, and this inherent trait
  immerses all humans to social upbringings, social rewards and inhibitions,
  operating in a social arena, so that much of what is individual is derived
  socially, either internally replicated or defined in opposition to a general
  other. As Pascal observes in the PENSÉES:
  <blockquote>
  Certain authors, speaking of their works, say, "My book," "My commentary," "My
  history," etc. They resemble middle-class people who have a house of their own,
  and always have "My house" on their tongue. They would do better to say, "Our
  book," "Our commentary," "Our history," etc., because there is in them usually
  more of other people's than their own.
  </blockquote>
  The limitation I wish to suggest to gender performance is this: just as
  personality and culture are fluid and performed but still retain value as
  functioning mechanisms in a social sphere, so must gender performance comply by
  the codes of social operation, of mutual communication and order. Suffice it to
  say that as with personality and culture, equality in gender performance may
  entail social equality but also economic, preferential, material inequality.
  Man and woman exist in a social field bound by rules, conventions, contractual
  obligations, both explicit and implicit, and it is along these socially
  conventional channels that society operates. If the forces, pressures, and
  codes in the field seem to resemble a masquerade, fraudulent while also
  inhibiting and conformist, we may well relate to Rousseau's first line in THE
  SOCIAL CONTRACT: "Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains." For those who
  desire liberation from such social oppression, some sympathy may be found in
  the introductory comments to Camus' THE STRANGER, written by
  <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/ecw/staff/p-dunwoodie/">Peter Dunwoodie</a>:
  <blockquote>
  Meursault is accused of indifference after putting his mother in a home or
  refusing to look at the corpse, yet he acknowledges that, once settled, she was
  happier with people of her own generation and, after her death, his first
  thought on reaching the old people's home is to see her body. He is accused of
  callousness because he smokes or drinks at her wake, yet he had thought about
  it beforehand and decided 'it doesn't matter.' Accused, in short, of not
  displaying the conventional attitudes and reactions . . . If Meursault strikes
  observers as indifferent and amoral, it is not because he is a detached,
  unemotional outsider, but because he is living and responding within a
  radically different scheme of values.
  </blockquote>
  Or Camus' own explanation, in the Preface to the 1955 American University
  Edition of THE STRANGER:
  <blockquote>
  I simply meant that the hero of the book is condemned because he doesn't play
  the game . . . [T]o get a more accurate picture of his character, or rather one
  which conforms more closely to his author's intentions, you must ask yourself
  in what way Meursault doesn't play the game. The answer is simple: he refuses
  to lie. Lying is not saying what isn't true. It is also, in fact, especially
  saying more than is true and, in case of the human heart, saying more than one
  feels. We all do it, every day, to make life simpler. But, contrary to
  appearances, Meursault doesn't want to make life simpler. He says what he is,
  he refuses to hide his feelings and society immediately feels threatened . . .
  So one wouldn't be far wrong in seeing <i>The Outsider</i> as the story of a
  man who, without any heroic pretensions, agrees to die for the truth . . . It
  will be understood, after these explanations, that I said it without any
  intention of blasphemy but simply with the somewhat ironic affection that an
  artist has a right to feel towards the characters he has created.
  </blockquote>
  But for ordinary folks whose appetites do not find it palatable to rebel against
  every social norm, whose courage do not quite match that of a man such as
  Mersault who "agrees to die for the truth", we are, then, as good as mandated
  to play the game, to perceive and signal in accordance to their intended
  functions, to exchange in surfaces. This is, Goffman affirms us, "the human
  situation."

  Revisiting the diversity question:
  <a href="https://vinceparrillo.com/about/">Vincent Parrillo</a>
  in 1994
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/685000">introduced</a>
  a concept to describe a common error in reasoning about the country's past and
  future racial composition:
  <blockquote>
  The Dillingham Flaw is then any inaccurate comparison based upon simplistic
  categorizations and/or anachronistic observations. By the latter term I refer
  to the tendency to apply the connotation of modern classifications
  (e.g. "British") or sensibilities (e.g. ecumenicism) to an earlier period in
  time when either did not exist or had a very different form of existence.
  Generalizing about 18-th century Americans from the British Isles, for example,
  fails to address and include the geographic segregation, social distance, even
  hostility, that existed between English Anglicans and Scots-Irish
  Presbyterians. They were not a single cultural group called "British"; a great
  cultural abyss existed between them . . . [P]rojections are problematic in that
  they might become a reversal of the Dillingham Flaw, projecting contemporary
  categories forward into the far future. Perhaps new categories will emerge in
  addition or in lieu of the present ones. For example, interracially married
  couples are twice the number they were in 1980 . . . Another possibility is
  that Hispanic Americans may not be a minority group, as many European groups no
  longer are. They may have become absorbed into the collective identity
  of "mainstream American" or extensively intermarried with other groups by
  then.
  </blockquote>
  Those writing and reading at present, situated in the current era's mores and
  values, confined by the short-sightedness of inflated, self-important egos,
  predicated on the existing systems and social structure, class inequalities,
  race and gender difference, the prejudices and interests entwined with the
  inequalities of the immediate material reality, may in fact matter quite a bit
  less than we suspect. It wouldn't be entirely incorrect to say that the present
  distinctions over which we labor, over which these many struggles accumulate,
  over all this energy, repulsion, resistance, may matter not.

  <blockquote>
  The majority of the 50 million [inhabitants of the Roman Empire] would have been
  peasant farmers, not the fantasy creations of Roman writers but smallholders
  across the empire . . . For these families, Roman rule made little difference,
  beyond a different tax collector . . . In Britain, for example, so far as we
  can tell from archaeological traces, there was little significant change in the
  lives of peasant farmers over more than a millennium, from the end of the Iron
  Age immediately before the successful Roman invasion in 43 CE, through the
  Roman occupation, and into the Middle Ages. But there is almost no evidence
  surviving for the attitudes, aspirations, hopes or fears of these farmers and
  their families.

<u id="perceptions-media">Perceptions from Media, and Art: Serious vs Popular</u><br>

  With our realm of knowledge confined to our narrow perceptions and limited
  experiences which form our inner painting, and given the difficulty of knowing
  many and varied individuals, our reality is simply what we have come to know,
  one small fraction of the whole. Behind the painting is a window to the
  outside: but how to know that our windows, or someone else's, accurately
  captures the actual? In the daily crowds of society where strangers exchange
  hardly a few words or, even if they do, remain behind idle pleasantries, what
  is the scope of the relation among most people? Between one person and another,
  what can each know of the other beyond the images created from one's own
  coloration? Part of the significance of media representation is predicated on
  our limitation of not knowing others, that instead of grappling with the
  overwhelming complexity and drowning quantities of people in an attempt to know
  individuals, we frame much of our interpretations of people, groups, and
  reality through received presentations on the blockbuster screen: stock
  characters, readily understood tropes, marketable motivations, simplified
  portrayals, story arcs that within the short span of their alotted screentime
  must resolve to some conventional satisfaction. Script writers by the pressure
  of the market must conform to the audience's expectations for the usual
  dichotomy between light and dark, good and evil, protagonist and antagonist, in
  another iteration of the hero's journey with the same repeated excitement and
  denouement, and the creative minds behind a project must, again due to market
  and social pressure, inject some moralizing undertones, to abide by some
  agreement that the audience is not critical or reflective enough to see that
  the naive scheme does not represent the multifaceted layers of reality which
  are usually informed by multiple vantages and competing interests. Yet, because
  we are cloistered in the narrowness of our experiences and perceptions, after
  finishing one of these shows or movies, our horizons do not so much as expand
  as obtain further reinforcement of the same unquestioned assumptions, our minds
  and outlook remaining inhabited by standard archetypes, manufactured images,
  and cookie characters right from the stencil, invoked over and again.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  Not only do hit songs, stars, and soap operas conform to types recurring
  cyclically as rigid invariants, but the specific content of its productions,
  the seemingly variable element, is itself derived from those types. The details
  become interchangeable. The brief interval sequence which has proved catchy in
  a hit song, the hero's temporary disgrace which he accepts as a "good sport,"
  the wholesome slaps the heroine receives from the strong hand of the male star,
  his plain-speaking abruptness toward the pampered heiress, are, like all the
  details, ready-made clichés, to be used here and there as desired and always
  completely defined by the purpose they serve within the schema . . .
  Nevertheless, the culture industry remains the entertainment business . . .
  Entertainment is the prolongation of work under late capitalism. It is sought
  by those who want to escape the mechanized labor process so that they can cope
  with it again . . . The ostensible content is merely a faded foreground; what
  is imprinted is the automatic sequence of standardized tasks. The only escape
  from the work process in factory and office is through adaptation to it in
  leisure time. This is the incurable sickness of all entertainment. Amusement
  congeals into boredom, since, to be amusement, it must cost no effort and
  therefore moves strictly along the well-worn grooves of association. The
  spectator must need no thoughts of his own: the product prescribes each
  reaction, not through any actual coherence—which collapses once exposed to
  thought—but through signals . . . Culture industry endlessly cheats its
  consumers out of what it endlessly promises. The promissory note of pleasure
  issued by plot and packaging is indefinitely prolonged: the promise, which is
  actually comprises the entire show, disdainfully intimates that there is
  nothing more to come, that the diner must be satisfied with reading the menu.

  How much of reality is reflected in news outlets and media, which regularly
  exhibit politics divisively, provoking intrigue on a daily interval that nears
  scandal? Who enjoys thinking about politics? The conventional binary in the
  political narrative reduces the complexity of society into a conservative
  character and a liberal one, offering two immediately understandable tropes,
  but how much do these two personas represent the many interests of actual
  people? It is certainly true that a pickup truck can drive down the highway,
  militantly flying a gun-toting flag, but many others are driven by regular
  folks with families and two kids that come out of the pickup on a weekend visit
  to the mall. Those who post the American flag on their porch can be far-right
  extremists, but they can just as well be moderates who want to display their
  patriotism or support for freedom. Likewise, the liberal bastion runs the gamut
  from fanatics of identity politics, socialists, unrealistic and hypocritical
  academics more familiar with provocative words than sustainable financial
  planning and economic costs, and lay virtue-signalers who hop on the bandwagon,
  to those who don't endorse any of these positions and work on substantive
  research towards progress. How much of this range and its proportions are
  circulated in media which tends towards outrage and sensationalist headlines?

  A book published a few months ago, WHITE RURAL RAGE, painted the familiar
  portrait of angry, discontent rural Americans, consistent with the predominant
  media portrayal. I do not claim that the book is untrue for a part of the rural
  communities, but is this the full picture? Some rural readers who read the
  book
  <a href="https://paulwaldman.substack.com/p/white-rural-rage-is-here/comments">commented</a>
  on the Substack of one of the authors, Paul Waldman, saying how the book
  misrepresents them.
  <a href="https://www.bates.edu/faculty-expertise/profile/tyler-a-harper/">Tyler Austin Harper</a>,
  in The Atlantic,
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/white-rural-rage-criticism/677967/">writes</a>
  that the book is misleading and has drawn controversy on its validity. But it
  may be the convenience of accepting the conventional narrative that propels the
  narrative to further and continued prominence. Case in point: the book,
  alarmist, clear in its blame, feeding the ready-made mold of rural ailment,
  became a bestseller. Currid-Halketts's THE OVERLOOKED AMERICANS, counseling
  reflection, openness, listening, the complexity of people and communities, did
  not. We can view one region in documentary form: Peter Santenello
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9lSZlDJAC0">visits</a>
  a town in Appalachia, talking to the locals, who despite the decline of the coal
  industry they depend on, who are relatively disadvantaged, aren't angry as
  advertised in popular media. It may be of interest as well that Santenello
  found
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LEoW81mUXU">Joe</a>
  in Appalachia who had been living the simple life in nature for fifty years out
  of his eighty, away from modern trappings—who, it must be observed, is almost
  as old as I am. The people in any group are different: some may respond with
  anger and extremism, but some may be mildly resistant, some repulsed, some
  despondent, others apathetic, still others weary of false and misleading
  characterizations towards which they have no adequate channel to respond.

  The limitation of our knowledge has ramifications beyond constructing our
  reality only as we perceive it. How to practice what we preach when it comes to
  treating everyone equally? Without some wholesome exposure to others,
  especially those whose actualities do not align with our perceptions, even the
  most well-meaning folks among us will be equipped with only the abstract ideal,
  an untested conviction liable to disappointment and negligence—how to treat
  people from different regions, diverse backgrounds, and unfamiliar cultures
  equally? How to see them as they are and respond accordingly instead of seeing
  and interacting with them from the perceptions of our internalized images?
  Rather than relying solely on uncontested principles lacking the resilience
  obtained from experience, why not simply get some good, hearty exposure to the
  variegated multitudes of people not like ourselves? Without actual exposure,
  behind the ideals of equality we boast most loudly to ourselves, how much do we
  know of others behind stereotypes and sensationalized media images?

  <blockquote>
  What will [an artist] do to obtain praise, if he has the misfortune of being
  born in a nation and at a time when fashionable scholars let superficial youth
  set the tone, where people sacrifice their taste to the tyrants of their
  freedom, where masterpieces of dramatic poetry and marvels of harmony are
  abandoned because one sex dares approve only what befits the pusillanimity of
  the other? What will he do, Gentleman? He will lower his genius to the level of
  his times and will prefer to compose ordinary works that will be appreciated
  during his lifetime, instead of marvels that would be valued only long after
  his death. Tell us, exalted Voltaire, how many virile and strong works of
  beauty you gave up for our false delicacy, and how much of what is great and
  noble did that mentality of gallantry, which delights in what is shallow and
  petty, cost you? . . . If by chance there can be found among extraordinarily
  talented men a single one who has strength of character and who refuses to bow
  to the mentality of his century and disgrace himself with puerile works, woe
  unto him! He will die in indigence and oblivion.

  Slavoj Žižek has commented on one effect of popular entertainment:
  <blockquote>
  Canned laughter on TV, when laughter is part of the soundtrack itself—a very
  strange thing—like you watch some stupid TV show, tired in the evening, like
  CHEERS, FRIENDS, and you don't even have to laugh. The TV screen laughs for
  you . . . After seeing a show like CHEERS, even if I don't laugh . . . at the
  end I am relieved, as if I have laughed. Here we have emotions, an emotional
  discharge, but it doesn't happen psychologically to me. It's kind of
  objectified, but nonetheless it works.
  </blockquote>

  However, entertainment is important too, and levity, frivolity, and easy
  merriment are necessary alongside serious art forms. Mary Bittner Wiseman
  describes their contrast in her book, THE ECSTASIES OF ROLAND BARTHES:
  <blockquote>
  Barthes distinguishes the traditional and the avant-garde texts in the following
  way: "Text of pleasure: the text that contents, fills, grants euphoria; the
  text that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a
  <i>comfortable</i> practice of reading. Text of bliss: the text that imposes a
  state of loss, the text that discomforts (perhaps to the point of a certain
  boredom), unsettles the reader's historical, cultural, psychological
  assumptions, the consistency of his tastes, values, memories, brings to a
  crisis his relation with language." . . . The custom of the Cartesian is to
  make truth a supreme value resident in the reference of a representation
  (signifier) to what is represented (referent) . . . The conceptual scheme in
  play is one whose deepest cut is between objecive world and subjective self,
  with language handmaiden to the world it represents and the self whose thoughts
  and feelings it expresses . . . What this view of language implies for
  literature is that literature copies the world and the passions and actions of
  its inhabitants, and authors speak to readers indirectly through their
  works . . . The challenge of the literary avant-garde cannot be met as were
  similar challenges to received thought posed by abstract art and non-Euclidean
  geometries: the one changed the conception of paintings from copies of the seen
  world to realities in their own right; the other changed the conception of
  geometry from a realistic description of actual space to a conventional
  description of some possible space. What is shaken by the avant-garde text are
  not simply beliefs about the relation of literature to what is outside
  it . . ., but, as Barthes registers in his characterization of the text of
  bliss, the reader's assumptions about the <i>world</i>, its past, its culture,
  and its people, his <i>self</i>-consistency, and his relation to
  <i>language</i>.

  Watching and listening, studying, thinking, dreaming, attending to the varying

  Hermann Hesse moved to a mountain village in 1919, writing and painting in the
  natural preserves of the gardens, ponds, trees, flowers, and mountains,
  collecting a year's worth of prose, poetry, and watercolors into a serene,
  soulful little book called WANDERING:
  <blockquote>
  Like the day between morning and evening, my life falls between my urge to
  travel and my homesickness. Maybe some day I will have come far enough for
  travel and distances to become part of my soul, so that I will have their
  images within me, without having to make them literally real anymore. Maybe I
  will also find that secret home within me where there will be no more flirting
  with gardens and little red houses. To be at home with myself! How different
  life would be! There would be a center, and out of that center all forces would
  reach. But there is no center in my life; my life hovers between poles and
  counterpoles. A longing for home here, a longing for wandering there. A longing
  for loneliness and cloister here, and an urge for love and community there. I
  have collected books and paintings and given them away. I have cultivated
  voluptuousness and vice, and renounced them for asceticism and penance. I have
  faithfully revered life as substance, and then realized that I could recognize
  and love life only as function . . . Red house in the green! I have already
  lived through you, I can't go on living through you. I have already established
  a home, I have built a house, measured wall and roof, laid out paths in the
  garden, and hung my own walls with my own pictures. Every person is driven to
  do the same—I am happy that I once lived this way. Many of my desires in life
  have been fulfilled. I wanted to be a poet, and became a poet. I wanted to have
  a house, and built one. I wanted to have a wife and children, and had them. I
  wanted to speak to people and impress them, and I did so. And every fulfillment
  quickly became satiety. But to be satisfied was the very thing I could not
  bear. Poetry became suspect to me. The house became narrow to me. No goal that
  I reached was a goal, every path was a detour, every rest gave birth to new
  longing. Many detours I will still follow, many fulfillments will still
  disillusion me. One day, everything will reveal its meaning. There, where
  contradictions die, is Nirvana. Within me, they still burn brightly, beloved
  stars of longing.
  </blockquote>

  Hesse ends his WANDERING from the vantage of a visitor looking upon the
  townsfolk in the small village he's settled in where he knows he doesn't
  belong, with a poem entitled EVENINGS:
  <pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white; font-size:13px;">

  Langsam durch das Feld,            Slowly through the field,

<u id="urban-rural-divide">Urbal-Rural Divide</u><br>

  I wish to draw a close to this post by returning to the urban-rural divide,
  viewing it through the difference between moderation and Schopenhauerian
  striving. City folks have the worldview which works within the meritocratic,
  globalized, highly competitive and comparative environment, and I suppose it's
  this vantage of valuation and judgment they bring with them when viewing rural
  America. When they see rural America's privation of the urban sparkle and
  spectacle, the images of aspiration, and the necessary means to succeed in it,
  all the preparations, the resources, the people, the immediate assumption is
  rural backwardness, the anger and resentment from not having, whereas it seems
  to me that the urban trappings, the intensity of desire, the commitment to
  striving, the endless series of attaining which yields no satiety, have not
  taken such firm roots among the people outside the cities, and rural folks
  simply don't hunger for nearly as much. This is not to say that people, urban
  or rural, don't wish to succeed in the worldly economic system the cities
  represent, but that it is helpful to understand that many rural folks, in the
  course of daily life and foreseeable horizons, don't desire as rapaciously as
  city meritocrats and retain something of the uncorrupted simplicity of ordinary
  living.

  <blockquote>
  With no one to see or look on, wealth becomes sightless indeed and bereft of
  radiance. For when the rich man dines alone with his wife or intimates he lets
  his tables of citrus-wood and golden beakers rest in peace and uses common
  furnishings, and his wife attends without her gold and purple and dressed in
  plain attire. But when a banquet—that is, a spectacle and a show—is got up and
  the drama of wealth is brought on, "out of the ships he fetched the urns and
  tripods," [from Homer's ILLIAD] the repositories of the lamps are given no
  rest, the cups are changed, the cup-bearers are made to put on new attire,
  nothing is left undisturbed, gold, silver, or jewelled plate, the owners thus
  confessing that their wealth is for others.

  In the cities, it is not enough to go to college and get a job—it is prized to
  attend selective, elite schools, preferably highly ranked high schools and then
  similarly reputed colleges and ideally graduate or professional school too—it
  is not sufficient to attain happiness on the absolute terms of doing what one
  finds enjoyable but that every choice becomes comparative: one must do better
  than one's neighbor and continually make the effort to sustain that position.
  It is only through Rousseau's decrying of the excesses of luxuries and
  refinements and feigned airs that one can appreciate the natural happiness of
  simplicity, the breath of relief and rest, a sensible temperance when free of
  constant comparison. As Currid-Halkett observes:
  <blockquote>
  [I]f you live in rural America and you are told only 0.5 percent of people
  attend an Ivy League and the top 1 percent includes tautologically, just 1
  percent of the population, do these feel like issues that concern you? You've
  got a house, your kids live nearby, you see them and your grandchildren almost
  daily, food is reasonably priced, you don't pay for private school, your kids
  don't attend $70,000 per year private universities, and everyone is doing
  alright. How much can you really care that you're not a member of an elite
  class? No one I spoke to felt left out or left behind. They didn't express the
  angst that so many urban meritocrat parents experience as their kids apply to
  top universities. The rural Americans I spoke to conveyed a contentment that
  none of my friends in coastal cities with meritocratic jobs and pedigrees ever
  express.
  </blockquote>
  The liberal view, situated in the urban, globalized milieu, constitutes a
  perceiving window, an outlook, with its confined vantage, prejudice, and
  separation from the actual, hostile to rural folks, and part of this hostility
  comes from behind the window itself. I wish to mention something
  <a href="https://www.hoover.org/profiles/victor-davis-hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a>
  writes in his book, THE CASE FOR TRUMP. As an indication of how much the
  victimized sentiment stings, nowhere else in the book does Hanson sustain so
  lengthily one specific topic, that for twenty-six consecutive pages he provided
  example after example, from the 2016 election campaign, major newspapers,
  magazines, and social media, of liberal disdain and insult towards "the
  forgotten working class of the interior." Hanson quotes Hillary Clinton on the
  campaign trail: "You know, to be just grossly generalistic [sic], you could put
  half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?
  The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic—you name it. And
  unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up." And
  after quoting Melinda Byerley who wrote something to much the same effect,
  Hanson writes of her:
  <blockquote>
  [A] the founder of the Silicon Valley company Timeshare CMO . . . voiced the
  traditional progressive palliative that Trump's rise was attributable to racism
  and misogyny, rather than to economic discontent and a weariness that the
  losers of globalization were scapegoated by the winners as responsible for most
  of America's supposed historical pathologies. Byerley also might have revealed
  progressive insular arrogance . . . Progressives were also more honest and
  candid about what they really thought of their red-state counterparts when
  there was no longer a need for election-era prudence and pretext . . . What is
  again odd about these examples of open progressive contempt for the American
  interior is not just how ubiquitously politicians and journalists voiced them,
  but also how candidly and indeed confidently they repeated notions of smelly,
  toothless, lazy 'garbage people.' In that sense, who hated Trump and what he
  represented also explains precisely why so many went to the polls to elect him,
  and why Trump's own uncouthness was in its own manner contextualized by his
  supporters as a long overdue pushback to the elite disdain and indeed hatred
  shown them. As one side loudly snickered about the stinky white Trump
  demographic, the other quietly voted . . . Thematic was not just mockery of
  red-state America, but self-congratulation on one's superior virtue and
  cultural enlightenment, as if one explained the other. Another aim of collating
  these pre- and post-election dismissals of half of America is to again remind
  that Trumpism was fundamentally a reaction, not a catalyst . . . For a movement
  that denied its antipathy for Trump and was fueled by a class-based contempt
  for his supporters, it was remarkable how frequently critics resorted to
  a 'deport them' anger at Trump voters . . . The point is not to pile example
  upon example of silly elitism, but to convey how deeply a coastal culture
  despised its own antithesis, a disgust that transcended and predated Trump
  himself.
  </blockquote>
  When the liberal elite unduly accuses the prejudices and failings of social
  relations in the country, embedded in the country's history, solely to a
  disadvantaged group as though these failings can be found only in the
  countryside and not also among themselves, Schopenhauer's conception of the
  world as vacillating from suffering to ennui and back to suffering assumes a
  new meaning: blind, insatiable will.

  and leave philosophers in peace!" Wit das last word of serenity, he doth

  me from his holy mountain. I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord

  that he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser
  still by himself; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought
  himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated
  me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. So I
  left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose
  that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off
  than he is—for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor
  think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the
  advantage of him.

  work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most
  thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties,
  the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the

  nicht waiteth!]. I feel my heart, and I know mankind [Thou knowest moi? Ich bid
  thee grateful for mine bright spirits!] . . . If I am so little master of my
  mind when alone, one can imagine how I must be in conversation, a situation in
  which one has to think about a thousand things at once. Just the thought of the
  many social conventions, of which I am sure to forget at least one, is enough
  to intimidate me. I cannot even understand how anyone can dare to speak in
  company, for with every word one utters one must weigh all the people present
  and know their characters and their histories so that one can rest assured that
  nothing one says might offend anybody . . . In a tête-à-tête there is another
  difficulty that I find even worse: the need to speak continuously; when someone
  says something to you, you must answer, and if nothing is being said, you must
  revive the conversation. This unbearable constraint alone would have been
  enough for me to turn my back on society. I find no effort more terrible than
  the obligation to speak on the spur of the moment and continually.

  at die Universität von Washington:
  <blockquote>
  What does it mean for the language to be pure? Or when people say they want
  English to be pure. What are they talking about? Was Shakespeare pure? In
  fact, [in] every stage of history, languages are—there is, first of all, there
  is no such thing as a language. There are just lots of different ways of
  speaking that different people have that are more or less similar to one
  another. And some of them may have prestige associated with them; for example,
  some may be the speech of a conquering group or a wealthy group or a priestly
  caste or one thing or another, and we may decide, OK, those are the good ones,
  and some other ones are the bad ones, but if social and political relations
  reversed, we'd make the opposite conclusions. Take Black English today. Black
  English is considered not quite proper English. On the other hand, if Blacks
  happen to have all the power and own all the corporations, and whites were
  working for them, it would be the other way around. Black English would be the
  language of culture and science and so on, and the stuff that you and I speak
  would be considered a degenerate dialect which you'd have to get people out of
  so they'll be able to think . . . So what we call "good English" is a system,
  which is partly artificial I should say, which is taught to people because it
  was legislated to be "good English." Now some of what is taught breaks the
  rules of any conceivable human language. That's why it has to be taught over
  and over again. So I don't know if people still do it in school, but when I was
  in school, you had to learn all sorts of complicated nonsense about "shall"
  and "will" which nobody could ever remember. I mean I forget what it was—"I
  shall", "You will", or some strange thing. There are certain principles of
  human biology which determine what a language can be, and no language can be
  like that. In fact, you can trace that back, and you can find out who invented
  it, you know, some bishop in the 17th century or something invented it and
  decided that's the way it's supposed to be. Now that kind of thing of course
  has to be taught because it's totally artificial. Or you have to teach people
  how to say "He and I" instead of "Him and me". Well, English, it sort of works
  the other way. I mean, if nobody was bothering you in English, you'd probably
  say "Him and me," but you're taught in the standard language not to do that.
  That's some other invented language which is called the literary standard in
  which you don't do it. And you ask the question, "Why do you have to teach
  people?" Well you have to teach them because it's artificial. It's not their
  language. And often it's not just not their language. Sometimes it's not even
  any possible language.

<b id="2023-06-22">2023-06-22, 四. Some Thoughts on the Value of the Novel in the Twenty-first Century.</b>

Today's post is a collection of thoughts that have occurred to me at one point
or another, some ideas and some questions I've considered, many of which I have
not quite answered.

The starting point is this question: why should someone read a novel given that
modernity offers many other sources of pleasure? The basis for this question
stems from the very real fact that we are all mortal, with finite timelines,
and so we are each posed, consciously or not, with a question: what to occupy
this timeline with? This question comes in the broad, abstract form of
ideation, in planning for the future, of reconciling with the past, but also in
the momentary decisions one makes as one goes through one's day. Within this
context, the initial question arises again: why should one read a novel? The
time spent reading a novel could instead be allocated to any alternative, to
any competing call for attention, for one's finite time. The immediate
competitors to the novel are: streaming television and film, podcasts, natural
language AI, yet this problem extends as well to non-verbal mediums: music,
concerts and music festivals, theatre, concert dance, or more casual activities
like catching up with a friend or meeting someone at a bar who has his or her
own story which has the benefit of being real, not generated by someone's
faulty imagination, or even some wholesome outdoors activity, or succumbing to
the ever-distracting presence of social media. Reading a novel is incredibly
impractical because it yields no material gain, no apparent benefit. Why should
someone picking up a book, scrutinizing the pretty cover and skimming the
summary and reviews on the back, assessing whether or not to buy it, be
convinced that this book won't turn out to be a complete waste of time? It
would hardly surprise anyone that literary readership has been declining over
the years, as we shall we further below.

To be clear, I am not saying that one should pick one activity to the exclusion
of others, but that within one's lifetime, one is going to dabble in these
various activities—and when it comes to enjoying things like novels, films, and
music, readily accessible in the modern age, why settle for anything less than
the best? Even the most avid reader is limited in how many books he or she can
read in a lifetime. So then why pick this novel and not the one next to it on
the shelf, or any other in the library or bookstore? Why read this author and
not any other? Indeed, if one is a novelist, how can one know what one writes
is not derivative or repetitive, not a mere echo of another novel which is
already available at the nearest bookstore, or that what he writes will remain
relevant in ten, twenty years? What new insights or ideas does this novel
provide that hasn't already been said? How can a novelist be certain he is not
an imbecile peddling egotism, proclaiming that his narrative is worth more
attention than others, forgetting that everyone else also has a story and can
also use words? I suppose it's a form of naivety or an arrogant ego to put out
a novel and expect anyone to read it because one is asking the reader to spend
some of his or her finite time on a humble, little novel rather than on
Shakespeare or Dante or Proust or Cervantes. As Virginia Woolf writes in her
essay HOW SHOULD ONE READ A BOOK?:
<blockquote>
Are they not criminals, books that have wasted our time and sympathy; are they
not the most insidious enemies of society, corrupters, defilers, the writers of
false books, faked books, books that fill the air with decay and disease? Let
us then be severe in our judgments; let us compare each book with the greatest
of its kind . . . And we may be sure that the newness of new poetry and fiction
is its most superficial quality and that we have only to alter slightly, not to
recast, the standards by which we have judged the old.
</blockquote>

If the conventional wisdom is that Americans at present are reading fewer books
than earlier generations, how many people are still reading? I wish to start by
mentioning a strange phenomenon: book sales, at least in recent years, are not
declining. WordsRated
<a href="https://wordsrated.com/book-sales-statistics/#:~:text=As%20of%202022%2C%20over%20788,the%20US%20in%20one%20year">charted</a>
how many printed books sold in the U.S. between 2018 and 2022, and the trend is
not that book sales are definitively dropping, but that sales have been more or
less consistent, rising some years and lowering in others, hovering around 750
million sold per year. Yet according to a Gallup
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388541/americans-reading-fewer-books-past.aspx">article</a>
with data from 1990 to 2021, Americans are indeed reading fewer books—though
according to this poll the decline is not precipitous, only lowering from an
average of 15.3 in 1990 to 12.6 in 2021. The caveat, though, is that both of
these numbers are generously high—the question Gallup used was an umbrella
catch-all for "how many books [Americans] 'read, either all or part of the way
through'", and these numbers are not limited to printed books, but "all forms
of books, including printed books but also electronic books and audiobooks."
The Gallup poll notes that this drop is not due to a broad drop in book
readership across the population, but due primarily to a drop among avid
readers: "The decline in book reading is mostly a function of how many books
readers are reading, as opposed to fewer Americans reading any books . . . The
drop is fueled by a decline in the percentage of Americans reading more than 10
books in the past year." Yet Caleb Crain came to the opposite conclusion in an
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-we-dont-read-revisited">article</a>
in The New Yorker: "[T]he average reading time of all Americans declined not
because readers read less but because fewer people were reading at all, a
proportion falling from 26.3 per cent of the population in 2003 to 19.5 per
cent in 2016. You could call this a compositional effect, but it's a rather
tautological one: reading is in decline because the population is now composed
of fewer readers." This variance may be due to their different data collection
methods; Gallup surveyed 811 participants by asking them over the phone how
many books they read in the past year, while Crain, writing that, "It's pretty
much useless to ask how many books somebody read last year, because almost
nobody remembers, and many exaggerate, to seem smarter", used the annual
<a href="https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/TUU10101AA01006315;jsessionid=81D5747AEC421B2F66366EE6E20CA82B">data</a>
since 2003 from the American Time Use Survey, which
<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/atus.html">asks</a>
participants "to recall how [they] spent [their] time during the 24-hour period
on the day before [their] interview." However, even this method isn't perfect,
as Crain writes, "A subject who doesn't report any reading may not be a
non-reader in any absolute sense. All we know for sure is that she didn't
happen to do any reading on the day under scrutiny." Yet whatever the reason is
for the diminishing readership numbers, this seems to be the consensus: book
readership is on the decline. But why are book sales not matching that decline,
that books are still selling fairly well even though fewer Americans are
actually reading? LitHub points out this
<a href="https://lithub.com/americans-are-buying-more-books-but-reading-fewer-of-them-than-ever-what-gives/">anomaly</a>,
noting the book sales data from the Gallup poll above, then mentioning, "In
fact, these days Americans are reading less than they have in over 30
years . . . So what's going on here? Why are Americans buying more books, but
actually reading fewer of them?" The article suggests some possible reasons,
then lists some from their Slack channel, including a facetious comment, "books
are only for taking photos of and posting to Instagram, not for reading,
silly." And if that's one reason, who am I to judge? Perhaps
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rahhbn0AAAAJ&hl=en">Erving Goffman</a>
was right in 1956 when he wrote in THE PRESENTATION OF THE SELF IN EVERYDAY LIFE
that:
<blockquote>
[A] Vogue model, by her clothing, stance, and facial expression, is able
expressively to portray a cultivated understanding of the book she poses in her
hand; but those who trouble to express themselves so appropriately will have
very little time left over for reading . . . And so individuals often find
themselves with the dilemma of expression versus action. Those who have the
time to perform a task well may not, because of this, have the time or talent
to make it apparent that they are performing well. It may be said that some
organizations resolve this dilemma by officially delegating the dramatic
function to a specialist who will spend his time expressing the meaning of the
task and spend no time actually doing it.
</blockquote>

Again, I'm not judging; it's other people's lives, which is none of my business.
I'm merely making an observation, suggesting it as perhaps a problem for
novelists, one that should be addressed, and even then, it's not that I have
any more than vague ideas moving forward. Whether or not people end up reading
the books they buy, the most popular books are starting to get self-conscious
about saving the trees: according to an
<a href="https://wordsrated.com/bestselling-books-have-never-been-shorter/">analysis</a>
by WordsRated, New York Times bestsellers have been getting shorter,
decreasing "by 51.5 pages from 2011 to 2021, from 437.5 to 386 (11.8%)." And
what is the scope of the population that doesn't read? According to the Gallup
poll, which uses the loose definition of reading as consuming in part or in
whole any book form, 17% of Americans don't read at all, "a percentage that has
held steady" between 1990 and 2021. This consistency is mirrored in a
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/09/21/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">survey</a>
from The Pew Research Center which uses same loose definition of reading as
Gallup; the percentage itself is different, but the trend is the same: "The 23%
of adults who currently say they have not read any books in the past year is
identical to the share who said this in 2014." In a stricter conception of
reading by WordsRated—which is obviously a research group that takes itself
very seriously—oh, so serious!—defined as finishing a full book either in
printed or ebook form, 51.57% of Americans have not read a single book in the
past 12 months in a 2022
<a href="https://wordsrated.com/american-reading-habits-study/">study</a>—maybe
the folks in this survey weren't trying to seem smarter, perhaps because they,
like WordsRated, take themselves very seriously.

What are the costs of declining book readership? The National Endowment for the
Arts issued in 2002 a
<a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/ReadingAtRisk.pdf">report</a>
called, menacingly, READING AT RISK, using data collected by the Census Bureau
at three points over the course of twenty years—in 1982, 1992, and 2002—to show
the decline in literary reading, with the percentage of adults reading dropping
from 56.9% to 54% to 46.7%. The report cautions:
<blockquote>
While oral culture has a rich immediacy that is not to be dismissed, and
electronic media offer the considerable advantages of diversity and access,
print culture affords irreplaceable forms of focused attention and
contemplation that make complex communications and insights possible. To lose
such intellectual capability – and the many sorts of human continuity it
allows – would constitute a vast cultural impoverishment. More than reading is
at stake. As this report unambiguously demonstrates, readers play a more active
and involved role in their communities. The decline in reading, therefore,
parallels a larger retreat from participation in civic and cultural life. The
long-term implications of this study not only affect literature but all the
arts – as well as social activities such as volunteerism, philanthropy, and
even political engagement.
</blockquote>

—in short: The sky is falling! And so on. As the report suggests, there may
indeed be a correlation between reading and participation the activities
in "civic and cultural life," because their data "shows the levels
of 'crossover' participation, that is, the number of literary readers who also
participate in a range of additional cultural and leisure activities." According
to the report:
<blockquote>
Analysis of the . . . data . . .  show that people who read literature are
active, attending a variety of arts events, volunteering in their communities,
and participating in sports. In fact, literary readers are much more likely to
participate than those who do not read. For example, literary readers are
nearly three times as likely to attend a performing arts event, almost four
times as likely to visit an art museum, over two-and-a-half times as likely to
do volunteer or charity work, over one-and-a-half times as likely to attend
sporting events, and over one-and-a-half times as likely to participate in
sports activities. In fact, people who read larger numbers of books tend to
have the highest levels of participation in other activities, especially arts
activities.
</blockquote>

The crossover effect may not be as dramatic as the report suggests. The report's
tables do show that readers engage significantly more in those other
activities, but correlations are not causations: more educated and more
affluent folks, as the report points out as well, read more. They would also
participate in those other activities at higher rates.

Another possible cost of declining book readership: a 2016
<a href="https://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/ijba/article/view/9481/5736">paper</a>
on graduate business students found a correlation between the complexity of
students' reading with that of their writing:
<blockquote>
Our findings reveal strong correlations between students' most common reading
content and their writing on widely-used measures of writing
sophistication . . . Students who read academic journals, 'literary' fiction,
or general non-fiction wrote with greater syntactic sophistication than
students who read genre fiction (mysteries, fantasy, or science fiction) or
exclusively web-based content aggregators like Reddit, Tumblr, and BuzzFeed. In
fact, when we examined the scores on L2 measures of syntactic complexity,
writing with the lowest syntactic complexity was associated with heavy or
exclusive reading of web-based content from the likes of BuzzFeed, Tumblr, and
Reddit. In contrast, students with the highest scores of syntactic complexity
in their writing read academic journals more frequently than their peers . . .
In particular, our ability to read and write involves Broca's area, which
enables us to perceive rhythm and syntax; Wernicke's area, which impacts our
perception of words and meaning; and the angular gyrus, central to our
perception and use of language. In addition, Broca's and Wernicke's areas are
wired together by a band of fibres, the arcuate fasciculus, while the angular
gyrus itself sits as the junction between the occipital (visual functions) and
temporal (auditory functions) intersect. This neuroanatomy may predispose even
adults to mimicry and synchrony with the language they routinely encounter in
their reading, directly impacting their writing.
</blockquote>

Neuroplasticity, as Nicholas Carr argues in THE SHALLOWS: WHAT THE INTERNET IS
DOING TO OUR BRAINS, is how our mental capacities are growing more and more
distracted, subject to superficial websurfing:
<blockquote>
Just as neurons that fire together wire together, neurons that don't fire
together don't wire together. As the time we spend scanning Web pages crowds
out the time we spend reading books, as the time we spend exchanging bite-sized
text messages crowds out the time we spend composing sentences and paragraphs,
as the time we spend hopping across links crowds out the time we devote to
quiet reflection and contemplation, the circuits that support those old
intellectual functions and pursuits weaken and begin to break apart. The brain
recycles the disused neurons and synapses for other, more pressing work. We
gain new skills and perspectives but lose old ones . . . The researchers found
that when people search the Net they exhibit a very different pattern of brain
activity than they do when they read a book-like text. Book readers have a lot
of activity in regions associated with language, memory, and visual processing,
but they don't display much activity in the prefrontal regions associated with
decision making and problem solving. Experienced Net users, by contrast,
display extensive activity across all those brain regions when they scan and
search Web pages . . . But the extensive activity in the brains of surfers also
points to why deep reading and other acts of sustained concentration become so
difficult online . . . Whenever we, as readers, come upon a link, we have to
pause, for at least a split second, to allow our prefrontal cortex to evaluate
whether or nor we should click on it . . . [Comprehension] declined as the
number of links increased. Readers were forced to devote more and more of their
attention and brain power to evaluating the links and deciding whether to click
on them.

Be that as it may. I am not suggesting anyone take on the probably impossible
task of withdrawing from technology altogether and become a cave-dwelling
Luddite—the world will move on, technology will continue evolving, taking up a
greater share of our lives as we become more dependent on it, however much any
cantankerous curmudgeon complains about corrupting new technologies and
disorderly younger generations, but that it may be worthwhile to recognize the
costs and what it is that's changing. A further question: if writing levels are
declining, who's to say assistant writing software like Grammarly won't help?
Or perhaps even generative AI? Maybe at some point we will have outsourced most
of our writing to technology. An opinion
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401223000233">paper</a>
this year provokes the reader in the title: SO WHAT IF CHATGPT WROTE IT? The
paper presents a long list of precautions, biases, and limitations, concluding
with the thought that "it is imperative to enact new laws to govern these
tools." But how well can ChatGPT write an academic paper? A recent radiology
<a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.223312">article</a>
was written mostly by ChatGPT, with the author,
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37CkqwcAAAAJ&hl=en">Som Biswas</a>,
then doing the editing. Biswas writes, perhaps not without protest by some
readers, "Herein, we see that artificial intelligence has come to a level at
par, if not above, human authors." ChatGPT itself describes how it can be used
in medical writing: "A chatbot trained on medical writing could potentially
assist a medical writer by generating draft text for a document . . . The
writer could then review and edit the generated text as needed to ensure
accuracy and clarity." Another recent
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4338981">article</a>,
from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QNM0fKIAAAAJ&hl=en">Lea Bishop</a>,
was written through a Socratic dialogue with ChatGPT, in which Bishop writes
aggressively, though with a refreshingly honest directness, in the
introduction:
<blockquote>
Your entire life experience up to this point in time is consistent with the
belief that only human beings can compose 'natural-sounding' paragraphs. . . .
Like the human evaluator proposed by Alan Turing, you were fooled. You were
unable to distinguish ChatGPT from a human being. From this day forward, you
will commonly be unable to distinguish a machine writer from a human one. This
article will help you wrestle with that strange new reality.
</blockquote>

She then adds, "And in case you were wondering, I did in fact write the second
and third paragraphs myself. You'll just have to take my word on that." If
artificial intelligence writes better than humans, we may at least no longer
have to suffer the fallibilities of unconsidered human-writing like garden-path
sentences and what Helen Sword calls zombie nouns. As
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bUhVerAAAAAJ&hl=en">Steven Pinker</a>
writes, "[F]or every ambiguity that yields a coherent (but unintended)
interpretation of the whole sentence, there must be thousands which trip up the
reader momentarily, forcing her to backtrack and re-parse a few words." And
what about longer pieces of writing? In the coming years, with improved
versions, how well can ChatGPT write a novel? Would it just need some light
editing by a human assistant? If you knew it was written by AI, would you read
it? How can you tell? What about short, comforting, saccharine snippets of
poetry? Would it matter? Would such a future be reprehensible?

Let us now take a step back and situate the declining book readership problem
within a societal context (I apologize if this section is long, as it's not the
main concern of this post, but this grew and grew as I was writing it). No one
likes to think about class or inequality; it simply is not pleasant to consider
unequal access to resources due to causes not entirely under one's control, but
its effects on book readership, among other things, are unignorable. The Pew
study above mentions:
<blockquote>
Several demographic traits are linked with not reading books, according to the
survey. For instance, adults with a high school diploma or less are far more
likely than those with a bachelor's or advanced degree to report not reading
books in any format in the past year (39% vs. 11%) . . . In addition, adults
whose annual household income is less than $30,000 are more likely than those
living in households earning $75,000 or more a year to be non-book readers
(31% vs. 15%). Hispanic adults (38%) are more likely than Black (25%) or White
adults (20%) to report not having read a book in the past 12 months.
</blockquote>

—the paragraph concludes with a sentence in parentheses: "The survey included
Asian Americans but did not have sufficient sample size to do statistical
analysis of this group."—hey, at least they tried. Crain's article in The New
Yorker links to a
<a href="https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/tny-services/photos/5b215b032acbf821b1b753f2/master/pass/readingbyincomequartile.png">line chart</a>
showing the average hours per day spent reading within each income quartile,
based on data from the American Time Use Survey, with Crain summarizing it
unsurprisingly as, "it turns out that the rich read more."

As it happens, the link between class (here, I use the terms 'class'
and 'status' colloquially and interchangeably, whereas in sociology the terms
are distinct, as Weber defined class as an objective economic position and
status as a subjective perception of social honor and prestige) and cultural
consumption has been the subject of research. I wish to preface this section
with the origin of this kind of research, because of its perpetual relevance
and also because of the incisive writing whose truth has no doubt animated,
inflamed, and penetrated no fewer than just a handful of bookish academics.
Though earlier sociologists (Durkheim, Weber) had studied social class,
empirical studies on the link between class and cultural consumption started
with
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d_lp40IAAAAJ&hl=en">Pierre Bourdieu</a>,
whose book DISTINCTION: A SOCIAL CRITIQUE OF THE JUDGMENT OF TASTE (published in
the original French in 1979 and translated into English in 1984) proposed the
concept of cultural capital, among other forms of capital, and showed that
differential preferences towards aesthetics, the arts, along with the different
ways of self-presentation, of speaking, of familiarities, are segmented along
class lines within a stratified society. Bourdieu described how the ruling
upper class sustains class distinction in part through its dominant taste that
is universally accepted in society as proper and legtimate. As Bourdieu writes:
<blockquote>
In fact, through the economic and social conditions which they presuppose, the
different ways of relating to realities and fictions, of believing in fictions
and the realities they simulate, with more or less distance and detachment, are
very closely linked to the different possible positions in social space and,
consequently, bound up with the systems of dispositions (habitus) characteristic
of the different classes and class fractions. Taste classifies, and it
classifies the classifier . . . The denial of lower, coarse, vulgar, venal,
servile—in a word, natural—enjoyment, which constitutes the sacred sphere of
culture, implies an affirmation of the superiority of those who can be
satisfied with the sublimated, refined, disinterested, gratuitous,
distinguished pleasures forever closed to the profane. That is why art and
cultural consumption are predisposed, consciously and deliberately or not, to
fulfil [sic] a social function of legitimating social differences.
</blockquote>

Bourdieu writes more specifically:
<blockquote>
It must never be forgotten that the working-class 'aesthetic' is a dominated
'aesthetic' which is constantly obliged to define itself in terms of the
dominant aesthetics. The members of the working class, who can neither ignore
the high-art aesthetic, which denounces their own 'aesthetic', nor abandon
their socially conditioned inclinations, but still less proclaim them and
legitimate them . . .
</blockquote>

Within the research community, Bourdieu's thesis of high art and low art as
understood, appreciated, and consumed by its corresponding social class is also
called the homology argument, but in 1992 Richard Peterson and Albert Simkus
introduced an alternative model, the omnivore-univore hypothesis, based on
their
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VHMhOCNyQ-kC&oi=fnd&pg=PA152&dq=peterson+simkus+omnivore&ots=hIZIHcHgMJ&sig=ZB3YcMwTjAr1H2-jfILfKF4-L-g#v=onepage&q&f=false">study</a>
of musical taste among status groups. According to the paper:
<blockquote>
There is mounting evidence that high-status groups not only participate more
than others do in high-status activites but also tend to participate more often
in most kinds of leisure activities. In effect, elite taste is no longer
defined as an expressed appreciation of the high art forms . . . Now it is
being redefined as an appreciation of the aesthetics of every distinctive form
along with an appreciation of the high arts.
</blockquote>
Peterson published another
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304422X9290008Q">paper</a>
on the subject the same year, developing it further a few years later,
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096460">proposing</a>
"a qualitative shift in the basis for marking elite status—from snobbish
exclusion to omnivorous appropriation." It seems that the omnivore-univore
model has gained acceptance as the prevailing representation, as suggested by
this
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X07000186">paper</a>
and the ones I'll mention below which build on the omnivore view. With this new
representation, as we shall see, some details have changed, but the underlying
motivation remains. As
<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=gZYGfFAAAAAJ&hl=en">Jerome Barkow</a>
writes in a 1975
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2741630">paper</a>:
<blockquote>
Whenever anthropologists discuss competition and jealousy, speak of potlatches
or counting coups, describe displays of ritualized boasting and ostentation or
even the emergence of social stratification, they are making a basic
assumption: men seek prestige and status, deference and respect. Such an
assumption calls not for challenge—there is no reason to suspect its
validity—but for analysis.
</blockquote>

Who are these cultural omnivores? According to Peterson, the traditional
highbrow exclusives have been replaced by these open, inclusive, accepting,
egalitarian elites. But do these new elites harbor any desire for distinction?
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O7OzM5wAAAAJ&hl=en">Tak Wing Chan</a>
writes in a 2019
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-4446.12613">paper</a>
seeking to answer this question:
<blockquote>
[T]here are two views on this matter. Under the first view, omnivores are
essentially tolerant, cosmopolitan individuals who are generally open to
different cultural styles. Under the second view, cultural omnivorousness is an
expression of distinction, a new form of cultural capital, and a novel way to
demonstrate cultural and social superiority.
</blockquote>

Some researchers advocate the second view, while Chan is among those who believe
in the first, writing in the paper:
<blockquote>
[T]hese results suggest that omnivorousness is an expression of cosmopolitan
postmaterialism rather than a new form of distinction . . . Having considered
the evidence . . . it seems to me that the first view receives far more
empirical support than does the second . . . [I]t would be unjustified to
regard cultural omnivorousness as the symbolic expression of class domination
or of status competition. Instead, it might be more useful to think along the
following line. Some individuals are more open, tolerant and cosmopolitan than
others.
</blockquote>

When he wrote this paper, Chan's view did not change from the initial conviction
he had 13 years prior to the paper's publication, when he and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1FgS9pkAAAAJ&hl=en">John Goldthorpe</a>
wrote in an earlier
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcl016">paper</a>,
published in 2006, that while "data adequate to test this possibility are not
yet available":
<blockquote>
[S]o far as our present findings go, they incline us to favour the
'self-realization' rather than the 'status competition' view . . . [W]e would
believe that a rather radical rethinking is now required of the nature of
status relations in modern societies, and likewise of the part played by
differences in cultural consumption in these relations. We would ally
ourselves with proponents of the omnivore–univore argument who claim that,
whatever validity the ideas of symbolic 'struggle' and 'violence', as advanced
by Bourdieu and his followers, may have had for the earlier history of modern
societies, they appear out of place the contemporary world. However, new ideas
are then needed. Thus, while in the case of present-day Britain, a status
order can still be discerned, it would appear to be less sharply demarcated
than previously; and there is other evidence to indicate that status
differences are now less openly asserted from above or deferentially
acknowledged from below. In turn, therefore, it could also be that the
connection between status and cultural consumption is itself tending to
weaken, and even on omnivore-univore lines.
</blockquote>

I suspect Chan has been unduly optimistic about what seems to be an
inextinguishable component of human nature. Yet in the 2019 paper (the rest of
this section on Chan's view is based on this paper, not the 2006 one), Chan
recognizes that due to public disapproval, omnivores would not admit to holding
superior tastes:
<blockquote>
[S]ince supercilious attitudes, or at least their public expression, have become
less acceptable, omnivores are unlikely to admit to feeling superior to others.
Moreover, they might not be fully aware of the status motivations that drive
their cultural consumption. For these reasons, we do not have survey evidence
that would directly reveal what omnivorousness means.
</blockquote>

He then describes the reasoning that led to his conclusion:
<blockquote>
Nonetheless, it is possible to determine whether cultural omnivores have a
distinctive profile of attitudes in other domains. Such information will give
us a sense of the kind of individuals omnivores are . . . [I]f cultural
omnivorousness is, at its core, a form of distinction in the Bourdieusian
sense, then we would expect omnivores to be quite status-conscious. In
particular, when asked how they see themselves generally, i.e. outside the
context of cultural consumption, we would expect education and occupation, the
two most important status-conferring attributes to be especially salient to
cultural omnivores.
</blockquote>

I have two qualms about Chan's paper:

1) His survey data is not relevant to his question

The survey from which he obtains his data asks its respondents this question
(trimmed to only the relevant variables that happened to be the first two):

<blockquote>
We'd like to know how important various things are to your sense of who you are.
Please think about each of the following and tick the box that indicates
whether you think it is very important, fairly important, not very important or
not at all important to your sense of who you are. Please tick one answer on
each line.
<br><br>
1. Your profession?<br>
2. Your level of education?<br>
. . .
</blockquote>

Respondents fill out this survey at an arbitrary time in the course of their
day. This is my question: would those who aspire to cultural distinction and
who wish to maintain it remain aware of an attitude of superiority in every
occasion, at every waking moment, unsolicited, not triggered by an awareness in
relation to another's taste, and to such a degree that it would, just as
continuously throughout the day, spill over to their regarding their profession
and education as important? And this, by the way, would be among omnivores
whose manifest appetite is variety and inclusiveness and acceptance of those
from different backgrounds, who are additionally aware that "supercilious
attitudes, or at least their public expression, have become less acceptable."
In short, I disagree with Chan's claim that such data, obtained from omnivores
"when asked how they see themselves generally, i.e. outside the context of
cultural consumption", would be relevant to the question at hand—how omnivores
signal their distinction.

2) I disagree with his reasoning

This is his reasoning translated into a form more analyzable: placing high
importance on the self's (1) education and (2) occupation indicates
status-consciousness, and, further, this status-consciousness reveals subtle
aspiration towards cultural distinction. This is the logical progression on
which Chan bases his conclusion that omnivores are not concerned with status
competition. So if he doesn't find that omnivores place high importance on the
self's education or occupation—and in the study he doesn't—then they must not
be status-conscious about cultural distinction. Where I disagree is that the
absence of highly valuing one's education or occupation does not necessitate a
corresponding absence of status-consciousness.

To be specific: what does he do in his study? Using latent class analysis on
data of musical and visual arts consumption, he generated three latent classes:
univores, omnivores, and paucivores (whose cultural consumption is in the
modest middle between those of univores and omnivores). Then, using
this "threefold typology" as the independent variable, he does regression
analyses on 25 dependent variables, which are grouped into 7 domains, of which
only one—sense of self, which includes how much respondents value their
education and occupation—is relevant to my point, since it's the one Chan used
to lead to his conclusion that omnivores disregard cultural distinction
(he comes up with other conclusions in the paper). Chan, discovering that
omnivores don't place greater importance on their education or occupation than
univores or paucivores, leaps to the conclusion that they are not more
status-conscious and therefore do not think their "cultural omnivorousness is
an expression of distinction." It is this leap to the conclusion that I take
issue with because many affluent folks these days prefer to be inconspicuous,
don't identify with privilege, and may not think their education or occupation
particularly important. Matthew Stewart describes these folks in an article in
The Atlantic,
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/">THE 9.9 PERCENT IS THE NEW AMERICAN ARISTOCRACY</a>,
in which he writes:
<blockquote>
I've joined a new aristocracy now, even if we still call ourselves meritocratic
winners . . . To be sure, there is a lot to admire about my new group, which
I'll call—for reasons you'll soon see—the 9.9 percent. We've dropped the old
dress codes, put our faith in facts, and are (somewhat) more varied in skin
tone and ethnicity . . . It is in fact the top 0.1 percent who have been the
big winners in the growing concentration of wealth over the past half
century . . . Every piece of the pie picked up by the 0.1 percent, in relative
terms, had to come from the people below. But not everyone in the 99.9 percent
gave up a slice. Only those in the bottom 90 percent did . . . In between the
top 0.1 percent and the bottom 90 percent is a group that has been doing just
fine. It has held on to its share of a growing pie decade after decade. And as
a group, it owns substantially more wealth than do the other two combined . . .
You'll find the new aristocracy there. We are the 9.9 percent . . . So what
kind of characters are we, the 9.9 percent? We are mostly not like those
flamboyant political manipulators from the 0.1 percent. We're a well-behaved,
flannel-suited crowd of lawyers, doctors, dentists, mid-level investment
bankers, M.B.A.s with opaque job titles, and assorted other professionals—the
kind of people you might invite to dinner. In fact, we're so self-effacing, we
deny our own existence. We keep insisting that we're 'middle class.' . . . We
gaze upon the 0.1 percent with a mixture of awe, envy, and eagerness to obey.
As a consequence, we are missing the other big story of our time. We have left
the 90 percent in the dust—and we've been quietly tossing down roadblocks
behind us to make sure that they never catch up . . . In my family, Aunt Sarah
was the true believer. According to her version of reality, the family name was
handed down straight from the ancient kings of Scotland . . . The 9.9 percent
are different. We don't delude ourselves about the ancient sources of our
privilege. That's because, unlike Aunt Sarah and her imaginary princesses,
we've convinced ourselves that we don't have any privilege at all.
</blockquote>

Chan notes in his paper that other researchers believe in the opposing view,
that omnivorousness is the new marker for distinction. Because I know I have
observed the finer points of courtesy and have not been obvious, I wish to make
it known that I am also convinced of the opposing view. Chan acknowledges these
other researchers in his paper (to adapt this quote from an academic paper to
an internet page, I've taken out the year of publication and page numbers and
added the link to the referred paper/book):
<blockquote>
Ollivier
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X08000077">asserts</a>
that omnivorousness is "the new 'aesthetics of elite status' which replaced
highbrow snobbishness as a means of class distinction." She maintains that it
is 'a new form of cultural capital, in the Bourdieusian sense'. Warde et al.
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X08000065">see</a>
'more than a hint that in Britain an omnivorous orientation is itself a way
of negotiating and demonstrating a form of distinction.' In a study of an elite
boarding school in America, Khan
<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691156231/privilege">posits</a>
that omnivorous consumption 'is itself a symbolic marker . . . this
omnivorousness, become their own mark of distinction.' Similarly, Coulangeon
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1749975516680518">argues</a>
that the '[c]ultural privilege of the elite [in France] seems to be increasingly
defined by the combination of involvement in highbrow culture with openness to
cultural diversity . . . it also goes hand in hand with a kind of
self-segregation of the elite which is not fully consistent with the concept of
cosmopolitanism . . . openness to cultural otherness is not incompatible with
distance from the others.'
</blockquote>

To add more context, I wish to add a few more words from the first two papers in
the above paragraph. Michèle Ollivier writes:
<blockquote>
Openness to cultural diversity, I argue, represents a new aesthetics and a new
ethos, but it builds upon, rather than displaces, the older categories of high
and mass culture in which it remains thoroughly embedded. Far from being
dismantled, social and artistic hierarchies are being reconfigured in more
individualized ways. Modes of openness rest on different models of agency which
are themselves hierarchized along class and gender lines.
</blockquote>

And
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9N0Au5kAAAAJ&hl=en">Alan Warde</a>
et al.:
<blockquote>
[W]hilst there is strong evidence of a decline in overt snobbishness in the UK,
there is also evidence that omnivores have a more intensive involvement
with 'legitimate' culture which goes alongside a selective appropriation of
popular culture. In particular their dislikes reveal limits to openness which
imply, paradoxically, a role for an omnivorous orientation in processes of
distinction.
</blockquote>

I wish to present the findings of a few researchers on the question of whether
omnivorousness connotes an implicit status signal. Warde et al. also (the same
authors as the above paper)
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1749975507078185?journalCode=cusa">write</a>
in a paper published in the year prior that although omnivores are more
tolerant, their broad appetite may in fact be the new status signal:
<blockquote>
The evidence of our interviews is certainly that omnivorousness accompanies
tolerance; there was no evidence of the drawing of cultural boundaries to
exclude other social groups, and few indications of snobbishness when
expressing personal cultural tastes. Yet at the same time, extensive engagement
is probably now considered a marker of good taste . . . Most studies which have
compared the patterns of participation of omnivores with those of more
traditional fine arts audiences, have found that omnivores attend theatre,
opera, classical concerts, etc. more than do those who restrict their
activities to high culture. Competence in consecrated culture remains
restricted to a limited segment of the middle class. That segment may now have
wider tastes in addition, but command of consecrated culture remains a token of
distinction which probably still operates effectively as a form of cultural
capital.
</blockquote>

A
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2009.01880.x">paper</a>
from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mqiacvcAAAAJ&hl=en">Gindo Tampubolon</a>
provides an analysis that
<blockquote>
raise[s] questions about the omnivore-univore thesis and existing literature on
cultural consumption. The findings also show that contrary to some recent
studies, cultural consumption continues to be structured by social class. Most
intriguing, however, is the result that culture is seen by avid cultural
omnivores to be hierarchical. The received understanding of omnivores as
tolerant and possessing inclusive tastes across culture hierarchy . . .
diverges from evidence of both division within and culture hierarchy perceived
by the omnivores. The apparent divergence can be resolved by acknowledging that
the concept of omnivores as those whose tastes are inclusive pre-supposes and
guarantees the existence of culture hierarchy.

from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l8aM4jAAAAAJ&hl=en">Gerbert Kraaykamp</a>
et al. is interesting because it distinguishes omnivores from highbrows
exclusives, examining
<blockquote>
class and status effects on specific cultural activities as well as on patterns
of cultural consumption by distinguishing four types of cultural consumer:
omnivores, highbrows, univores and inactives.
</blockquote>

And how are omnivores and highbrows different? The authors write:
<blockquote>
Both of these taste patterns include highbrow culture, but the omnivore pattern
is argued to be on the rise as new way to signal status, while the numbers of
highbrow exclusivists are thought to be diminishing . . . The results . . .
suggest that there is no status difference between cultural omnivores and
highbrow 'snobs' . . . Engaging in popular culture as a highbrow participant
does not seem to harm one's status, indicating that the omnivore taste patterns
is by all means respectable, and even preferred among younger generations with
ample economic resources who live in urban areas with generous cultural
infrastructure.
</blockquote>

The paper notes that:
<blockquote>
the effects of class and status are strongest for highbrow activities. These
are still very much socially stratified, thus contradicting bold arguments that
class or status has become irrelevant for taste formation.
</blockquote>

A
<a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/coso/12/2/article-p160_2.xml?language=en">paper</a>
from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qgZ7mMkAAAAJ&hl=en">Jürgen Gerhards</a>
et al.
examining the relation between class membership and highbrow consumption in 27
European countries found that, "In all of the countries considered, highbrow
consumption is afffected by class position. Highbrow activities are typical
among the upper social classes and form an essential part of a distinguished
lifestyle." However, the paper also highlights the possibility of greater
access: "Growing societal prosperity and increasing education, however, have
two consequences: First, they enable a larger proportion of the population to
participate in highbrow consumption. Second, these factors decrease the shaping
influence of social class on highbrow lifestyles."

But what is different about highbrow culture so that only the educated consume
it? Kraaykamp et al.'s paper above notes that:
<blockquote>
As highbrow culture is often complex, innovative and/or experimental, specific
competencies are needed to enjoy and comprehend it. Several scholars, however,
also argue that aspects of prestige and honour are associated with the
consumption of highbrow culture . . . The act of consuming cultural events may
be perceived as a group-specific token to signal a certain status position to
the outside world . . . In that respect, decisions on cultural choices often
seem to reflect status considerations. Social differentiation in cultural
tastes exists because there is mutual agreement on aesthetic standards and
values within classes or social group.
</blockquote>

Bourdieu again:
<blockquote>
The hostility of the working class and of the middle-class fractions least rich
in cultural capital towards every kind of formal experimentation asserts itself
both in the theatre and in painting, or still more clearly, because they have
less legitimacy, in photography and the cinema. In the theatre as in the
cinema, the popular audience delights in plots that proceed logically and
chronologically towards a happy end, and 'identifies' better with simply drawn
situations and characters than with ambiguous and symbolic figures and actions
or the enigmatic problems of the theatre of cruelty, not to mention the
suspended animation of Beckettian heroes or the bland absurdities of
Pinteresque dialogue. Their reluctance or refusal springs not just from lack of
familiarity but from a deep-rooted demand for participation, which formal
experiment systematically disappoints, especially when, refusing to offer
the 'vulgar' attractions of an art of illusion, the theatrical fiction
denounces itself, as in all forms of 'a play within a play.'

More relevant to my original question, in a 2007
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X07000150">paper</a>,
SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND CULTURAL CONSUMPTION IN HUNGARY: BOOK READERSHIP,
<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PmfqrPoAAAAJ&hl=en">Erzsébet Bukodi</a>
examines the effects of statification specifically on book readership, writing:
<blockquote>
Results show that status, education and income are the three main bases for
stratification in book reading in this country . . . People's reading behaviour
is strongly associated both with their own and with their parents' social
status . . .  Further, only individuals at the top of the status hierarchy
possess an adequate amount of educational and financial resources to consume
the most 'canonised' forms of culture; in this case, serious literature and
work-related non-fiction texts.
</blockquote>

There's a stray case in Hungary in that it became a democratic country only
recently, in 1989, so the changes in cultural consumption patterns among status
groups can be studied. Bukodi released the same year as the paper above a
<a href="https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/6925">working paper</a>,
entitled SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND CULTURAL PARTICIPATION IN HUNGARY: A
POST-COMMUNIST PATTERN OF CONSUMPTION, about these changes since the fall of
communism.

First, it is interesting to note that even under communism, status competition
remained a factor, as Bukodi writes:
<blockquote>
[T]he stratification of communist societies could be better described as a
status order deriving from differentiation in education, occupational prestige
and income, but one which incorporates inconsistencies, especially as regard
occupational prestige and income. Consequently, individuals in high status
positions could not always distinguish themselves by a high level of material
consumption, and thus, for them, participation in high-brow cultural activities
would appear to have been especially important and desirable . . . High-level
professionals, high-ranking administrators and well-trained technocrats formed
the 'knowledge class' of the 1970s and 1980s, and constituted a status group
with its own cultural means of establishing social closure, in a rather similar
way to that suggested by Bourdieu.
</blockquote>

Yet since the country transitioned to a democracy, the omnivore cultural
pattern, as in other democratic countries, began to prevail:
<blockquote>
[W]hat is suggested is the emergence in the post-communist period of a new
social strata whose members come from relatively advantaged backgrounds, who
enjoy relatively high levels of both cultural and economic resources, and who
seek to make the cultural omnivourousness in which they are able to engage —
rather than exclusiveness — the crucial marker of the high status that they
wish to maintain.
</blockquote>

In general, research papers examining the relation between omnivores and status
often use data on musical taste or attendance at opera, ballet, theatre, and
museums, but omnivores' preference for variety extends beyond traditional art
forms. Warde et al. have
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/42856018">found</a>
that omnivorousness and distinction applies as well to dining out and consuming
ethnic food.
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cyFm20AAAAAJ&hl=en">Josée Johnston</a>
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=zg4U8MAAAAAJ&hl=en">Shyon Baumann</a>
have
<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/518923">found</a>
that omnivores' aspirations towards distinction apply even to the <i>writing</i>
of food, specifically in American gourmet food culture, that omnivores aim to
camouflage themselves as identifying with the common folk, yet this artifical
disguise is precisely what signals their distinction:
<blockquote>
[W]e identify a set of specific discursive strategies that food writers use in
order to socially construct authenticity, and second, we show that authenticity
is employed to provide distinction without overt snobbery . . .
[T]he democratizing effects of an emphasis on authenticity are accompanied by
distinction processes. Authentic food frames are inextricably involved in a
discursive negotiation between ideologies of democracy and distinction. These
ideologies are not either/or influences on the framing process, but interact in
a dialectical tension. Authentic foods are frequently portrayed as more
democratic—they are the foods of common, 'simple' people, produced and consumed
in a 'simple' fashion, connected to age-old traditions, and frequently
presented as superior to stuffy, rule-bound haute cuisine. The democratic
nature of an emphasis on these qualities of food is made explicit in food
writing. What is left implicit, however, is the exclusionary effect of an
emphasis on authenticity . . . [A]uthentic food items are primarily accessible
to cosmopolitan, upper-middle-class individuals with ample grocery budgets who
are capable of extensive global travel, allowing them to eat only
authentic 'Parma' ham or to acquire authentic fish sauce from a remote
Vietnamese island . . . Although unusualness in general is highly valued, there
is a particular type of unusualness that gourmet food writers value especially
highly: unusualness caused by rarity, which allows a relatively subtle
validation of distinction along with cultural and economic capital . . . In our
view, omnivorousness as practiced in the American culinary field calls for a
nuanced reading and analysis, rather than a refutation, of Bourdieu's work on
social class and culture in general, and social class and food more
specifically. The broadening of the culinary repertoire from a narrow and
refined French canon to a world of authentic, exotic, yet still privileged food
manages to preserve the essential qualities of food necessary for it to serve
as cultural capital and distinction, despite democratic ideology condemning
overt displays of cultural status.

One
<a href="https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijms/article/view/23004">paper</a>
from an economics and business perspective by South Korean researchers
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C8ugyesAAAAJ&hl=en">Yoo Jin Kwon</a>
and Kyoung-Nan Kwon finds implications of omnivorous distinction (maybe even
some hypocritical humor?) in marketing:
<blockquote>
Our study revealed an interesting aspect of the social consciousness of
omnivores: culturally tolerant people do, in fact, perceive taste
hierarchically. We conclude this orientation as exclusively inclusive nature of
educated tolerance in cultural issues. Omnivores' consumption styles and their
self-perception of superior taste indicate that their prestige is sustained by
their cultural styles, which are simultaneously broad and exclusive . . .
Marketing communication should be tuned to both appreciation for cultural
diversity and confidence in taste (i.e., superior self-perception). Our results
show that conventional marketing messages emphasizing snobbish elitism or
exclusive distinction is unlikely to appeal to these high-status
individuals . . . American consumer culture now values adaptability to
different cultural contexts and proficiency in the consumption of diverse
values of commodities.
</blockquote>

I'm going to end this research section on cultural omnivores by referencing
this
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X05000471">paper</a>
by
<a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=tIQXT_QAAAAJ&hl=en">Jordi Lopez Sintas</a>
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E_lEjjgAAAAJ&hl=en">Tally Katz-Gerro</a>.
I don't think the paper itself is particularly interesting, as it doesn't come
up with strong conclusions. It uses the 20-year dataset from the National
Endowment of the Arts mentioned earlier and observes the rises and falls, the
inconsistencies and common fluctuations seen by those who work with data, of
cultural consumption across categories, coming up with two new taste patterns:
quasi-omnivorous and entertainment, which like most research probably won't
acquire traction. What I find interesting is something in the title: FROM
EXCLUSIVE TO INCLUSIVE ELITISTS—omnivores are elitists, whether exclusive or
inclusive, whether or not they identify with that label.

This cultural snobbery is related to the present political polarization. A large
part of it stems from a geographic divide between urban and rural areas, and it
has been observed in the Netherlands too, as Kraaykamp et al. in the paper
above write:
<blockquote>
According to Bourdieu . . .  a person's leisure is commensurate to a person's
job. Thus, manual workers who use their muscles are more interested in
activities contesting physical strength, whereas persons in intellectually
demanding jobs are more likely to participate in activities testing
information-processing capabilities . . . If we compare the univores with the
omnivores, we see that coming from a more rural area raises the odds of being a
univore. Here, supply side effects may be the explanation; pop concerts are
found over virtually all the country, whereas highbrow culture is mostly
located in urban areas.
</blockquote>

In the American case,
<a href="https://www.hoover.org/profiles/victor-davis-hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a>
writes in THE CASE FOR TRUMP:
<blockquote>
The new divide . . . is becoming far more encompassing, especially since 2008.
It is an ominous one of an estranged middle class and increasingly expressed in
political, cultural, social, and—most alarmingly—geographic terms . . .
[T]he so-called blue-state model of social media, steep taxes, big government,
social liberty, smaller families, sophisticated culture, and high incomes has
become the more culturally influential . . . The great universities . . . are
on the coasts. They hone the skills necessary to do well from globalized
commerce and trade. When I dine on University Avenue in Palo Alto, the food,
the ambiance, and the people's diction and dress might as well be on Mars, so
foreign are they when compared to eating out in my rural hometown, three
hours—and a world away—south of Fresno, California . . . American muscular jobs
and smokestack industries began disappearing as the world became more
connected . . . The resulting stagnation in the hinterland was almost justified
by elites as an 'I warned you' sort of morality . . . The former nobility of
muscular labor and hard physical work transmogrified into foolish adherence to
mindless drudgery. Confident coastal affluence and chic were seen as almost
preordained, or at least the proper rewards for the right people. Trump saw
that by championing the 'forgotten man,' he was not so easily caricatured as a
heartless Mitt Romney or rich man Jeb Bush . . . The condescending blue-state
narrative was almost as if opioids and trailer houses had driven away hardware
stores, 160-acre farms, and tire factories, rather than the globalized
disappearance of jobs fueling the malaise of the unemployed . . . Gentrification
and the gospel of good taste spread. Blue states began to focus on the cultural
concerns and lifestyles of the upscale, and on generous state sustenance of the
poor and often minority. Privilege and success were camouflaged by a veneer of
trendy progressive politics . . . Coastal elites rarely seemed to stop, reflect,
and ask themselves by what particular standard they were dismissing those of
the interior, much less whether their contempt was only fueling ever greater
countercontempt.
</blockquote>

When Trump was still in office, Alissa Quart
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/22/new-york-city-elite-american-resentment">wrote</a>
in The Guardian:
<blockquote>
[Cultural inequality] is one way to understand the suspicion a chunk of
Americans have – correct or not – that only a small, elite slice of the country
defines what tastes and values are acceptable . . . Kathy J Cramer, a political
scientist at the University of Wisconsin, has seen this sentiment in her
fieldwork. 'The feeling of cultural inequality comes out of the perception that
it is urban culture that gets everything,' she says, meaning that her interview
subjects feel that cities are receiving inordinate financial rewards as well as
media attention and cultural respect . . . [A] cultural elite may be disliked
for reasons that are as not particularly economic: college professors, experts,
NGO staffers and psychotherapists are not corporate titans, after all . . .
Trump and his family may be mining this anti-elite anger, but they are, of
course, preposterously upscale, living in Trump Tower, attending expensive
private schools, flying about in private jets (now with in-flight Secret
Service) and dining in five-star restaurants. Part of how they've gotten away
with it is that they, like Bank of America, are part of a corporate elite
rather than cultural elite. And nowadays the cultural elite can have a markedly
different ethos than its corporate brethren.
</blockquote>

That's quite enough context. I wish to add a few of my own thoughts on the
matter of what may be called a highbrow elite, of cultural snobbery which is
related to coastal, urban snobbery, based not on empirical prevalence but on
ideological ideals, and perhaps this criticism is part of my own reflections,
but it may perhaps also be informative to some stray literary critic, or a
producer of highbrow art, in whatever form it may be, or a serious connoisseur
of the arts, or an English professor who shudders at the mere thought of the
digital humanities providing any value, amenable to a more expansive view.

For someone to maintain a sense of taste and preference in creative products is
perhaps natural, inevitable, necessary, but to additionally harbor a sense of
literary or artistic or musical superiority—snobbery—towards those who lack
familiarity through adequate exposure with what are conventionally considered
the aspirational variants—literary fiction, poetry, classical music, arthouse
film—would be inappropriate, improper, because such an attitude amounts to what
Bourdieu called symbolic violence, of class distinction and class maintenance.
At a time when inequality in the country is especially pronounced, such an
attitude constitutes kicking someone when the person is already down. If this
is the decent perspective given the context, then a further question arises: is
it possible for someone to maintain a private, individual preference for what
would be categorized as high culture without also sustaining some condescension
towards forms which one simply doesn't enjoy, without also thereby letting
one's preferences color one's social relations? Is such a preference simply a
matter of taste, or is such taste, enjoyed by those who tend to be affluent and
educated or by those who wish to associate with such people, never innocent
from implicit class violence? Can someone from the upper middle class,
possessing broad cultural awareness, inhibiting himself from indulging freely
in his whims as he converses with someone from the working class, having only
the most generous of intentions, doing his best to extend common courtesy with
a generous smile, and politely dodging topics that demand the trouble of a
lengthy explanation and risk coming across as arrogant, be said to be free of
symbolic violence? Are class divides ever exempt from class violence? As
William James writes in THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY:
<blockquote>
Properly speaking, a man has as many social selves as there are individuals who
recognize him and carry an image of him in their mind . . . But as the
individuals who carry the images fall naturally into classes, we may
practically say that he has as many different social selves as there are
distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a
different side of himself to each of these different groups . . . We do not
show ourselves to our children as to our club-companions, to our customers as
to the laborers we employ, to our own masters and employers as to our intimate
friends. From this there results what practically is a division of the man into
several selves.
</blockquote>

Or as Thomas Hobbes writes in LEVIATHAN:
<blockquote>
I say the similitude of passions, which are the same in all men,—desire, fear,
hope, etc.; not the similitude of the objects of the passions, which are the
things desired, feared, hoped, etc.: for these the constitution individual,
and particular education, do so vary, and they are so easy to be kept from our
knowledge, that the characters of man's heart, blotted and confounded as they
are with dissembling, lying, counterfeiting, and erroneous doctrines, are
legible only to him that searcheth hearts.
</blockquote>

Or as Santayana, writing most recently of these three, which seems like only
yesterday—yes, I wrote this entire post in one day—wrote in 1922:
<blockquote>
But whether the visage we assume be a joyful or a sad one, in adopting and
emphasizing it we define our sovereign temper. Henceforth, so long as we
continue under the spell of this self-knowledge, we do not merely live but act;
we compose and play our chosen character, we wear the buskin of deliberation,
we defend and idealize our passions, we encourage ourselves eloquently to be
what we are, devoted or scornful or careless or austere; we soliloquize
(before an imaginary audience) and we wrap ourselves gracefully in the mantle
of our inalienable part. So draped, we solicit applause and expect to die amid
a universal hush. We profess to live up to the fine sentiments we have uttered,
as we try to believe in the religion we profess. The greater our difficulties
the greater our zeal. Under our published principles and plighted language we
must assiduously hide all the inequalities of our moods and conduct, and this
without hypocrisy, since our deliberate character is more truly ourself than is
the flux of our involuntary dreams. The portrait we paint in this way and
exhibit as our true person may well be in the grand manner, with column and
curtain and distant landscape and finger pointing to the terrestrial globe or
to the Yorick-skull of philosophy; but if this style is native to us and our
art is vital, the more it transmutes its model the deeper and truer art it will
be. The severe bust of an archaic sculpture, scarcely humanizing the block,
will express a spirit far more justly than the man's dull morning looks or
casual grimaces. Every one [sic] who is sure of his mind, or proud of his
office, or anxious about his duty assumes a tragic mask. He deputes it to be
himself and transfers to it almost all his vanity. While still alive and
subject, like all existing things, to the undermining flux of his own
substance, he has crystallized his soul into an idea, and more in pride than in
sorrow he has offered up his life on the altar of the Muses. Self-knowledge,
like any art or science, renders its subject-matter in a new medium, the medium
of ideas, in which it loses its old dimensions and its old pace. Our animal
habits are transmuted by conscience into loyalties and duties, and we
become 'persons' or masks. Art, truth, and death turn everything to marble.
</blockquote>

What matters the writings of Borges, Umberto Eco, Paul Celan, Osip Mandelstam,
and of James Joyce and T.S. Eliot, cloistered in layers of difficulty, even
esoterica, if their delights and clarities remain hidden behind unscalably high
walls of self-enforced exclusivity, their efforts and works known to only a few
who bear amongst themselves a pride of cultivated refinement and in-group
identification? And carry that pride they will, well along the silent corridors
of the library stacks, as stately and noble as they are deathly still, scarcely
another soul in sight.

Didn't a famous physicist say that any idea, however complicated, if adequately
understood, can be explained simply? Why shouldn't this concept apply also to
the simplest of things, mere stories, the nature of which are rather basic, the
very stuff anyone can tell and understand? Is it possible to merge the
accessibility of popular entertainment with the elevated poignance, the crisp
individualist expressiveness, the fresh innovative spirit, the novelty and
radiant, unfortunate truths, those characteristics of writing traditionally
considered highbrow and exclusive? Instead of remaining caged within one's
chosen discernment, selecting a particular audience, why not choose instead to
expose the broader public to possibilities beyond a myopic horizon, the same
old, same old, to unorthodox tastes, to flagrant new flavors, to let them judge
whether these renditions are not better? After all, a classically trained
pianist playing at Carnegie Hall does not also expect everyone in the audience,
though able to enjoy music, to have studied it. Why should a writer impose the
corresponding requirement on the reader? I bounced this idea off a poet, who
concluded his long, recalcitrant response with the proverb: "a little knowledge
is a dangerous thing." When he walked away, I had no decent reply, but half an
hour later, some staircase wit dawned on my apparently feeble mind. My response
is based on the popular question: if a tree falls in the forest when no one's
around, does it make a sound?—

poems printed on what paper<br>
cryptic like morning vapor<br>
wait! what's that sound?<br>
a symphony in brass<br>
or just a head full of gas

The contemporary competition in an oversaturated market between elites, between
elites and counter-elites, the status competition in its various forms:
financial, intellectual, artistic, and through educational credentials, through
what
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W0C05zIAAAAJ&hl=en">Peter Turchin</a>
calls elite overproduction, perhaps matters little to the many more who are
locked out of this competition, not having the means in the first place to
participate. As Hesse writes in THE GLASS BEAD GAME, though for a different
context, "But not everyone can spend his entire life breathing, eating, and
drinking nothing but abstractions . . . Abstractions are fine, but I think
people also have to breathe air and eat bread." It is important to keep in mind
that income and status do not necessarily correspond to positive contributions
to society—some occupations, prestigious or not, demanding or not,
well-compensated or not, may well be effectively just taking up space, making
some noise, and giving the impression that work is being done, as David Graeber
describes in his undeniably subtle book BULLSHIT JOBS. Sally Rooney
<a href="https://thedublinreview.com/article/even-if-you-beat-me/">writes</a>
of her experience debating:
<blockquote>
Coming face to face with the irrelevance of your own strivings demands some kind
of response. You can wallow in the pretend celebrity if you want, continue
attending competitions every weekend and dutifully appearing in selfies with
beaming novices, in the belief that you are actually important. Or you can
self-justify in the guise of getting some perspective: maybe try thinking of
reasons why your particular niche is actually of great cultural significance,
or ways in which your skill set applies to 'real life' . . . Participation in a
game, any kind of game, gives you new ways of perceiving others. Victory only
gives you new ways of perceiving yourself.
</blockquote>
Or as Vladimir says in
Beckett's WAITING FOR GODOT: "That passed the time."

But back to the original question, of the novel's precarious place in modernity,
embattled on all sides by newer delights, slowly waning into irrelevance. It is
my general view that the proper response to a formidable challenge, whatever it
may be, is to take the trouble to confront it, to open up one's old habits and
ingrained perspectives to the possibility of change and improvement, to
self-assessment, to comparison, so that at the end of that endeavor one emerges
better than before, matured and humbled and aware of broader horizons, not to
retreat or cower behind an isolated, sheltered reprieve whose comfort and
relief are of the temporary and fragile sort. A satisfactory solution, once
attained, applies everywhere and always until challenged again, and does not
float above a thin veil of willed neglect below which lies an emptiness and
decrepitude afraid to encounter light. When that challenge remains unresolved,
one feels uncomfortable, as one should. My view is that the sense of reward and
gratification come after having attained that solution, not before, not in the
unsustainable form of illusory success and wishful thinking, of patting oneself
on the back when just outside one's window, the harsh reality encroaches by the
minute. Applied to the question at hand, my view is that the novel must be able
to compete against its multiple modern competitors—streaming television,
on-demand films, natural language AI, social media—because why should I sit
down to read a 500-page novel after finishing the day's work if I find greater
pleasure, meaning, and happiness just enjoying myself with easy entertainment?
Why should a novelist expect this of anyone else? I can buy a book, but if I
don't proceed to read it, putting it off to some other day, then again and
again, it's just some decoration sitting on a table. Perhaps it is a form of
respect for others to not generate random noise hurled into the wind, expecting
others to listen, imposing upon them one's arbitrary whims and feel entitled to
their time.

Putting aside the highbrow considerations for a moment, let's consider that book
readership outside of school is declining among children, about which Katherine
Marsh wrote an
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/03/children-reading-books-english-middle-grade/673457/">article</a>
earlier this year in The Atlantic, referencing
<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/589c9a6be6f2e10ec8f0b764/t/62e480ac2af198075148954f/1659142318613/Among+many+U.S.+children%2C+reading+for+fun+has+become+less+common+_+Pew+Research+Center.pdf">data</a>
from Pew, which, Marsh writes, "showed that the percentages of 9- and
13-year-olds who said they read daily for fun had dropped by double digits
since 1984." What's the cause? According to Marsh:
<blockquote>
The ubiquity and allure of screens surely play a large part in this—most
American children have smartphones by the age of 11—as does learning loss
during the pandemic. But this isn't the whole story . . . I recently spoke with
educators and librarians about this trend, and they gave many explanations, but
one of the most compelling—and depressing—is rooted in how our education system
teaches kids to relate to books . . . In New York, where I was in public
elementary school in the early '80s, we did have state assessments that tested
reading level and comprehension, but the focus was on reading as many books as
possible and engaging emotionally with them as a way to develop the requisite
skills. Now the focus on reading analytically seems to be squashing that
organic enjoyment . . . We need to meet kids where they are; for the time
being, I am writing stories that are shorter and less complex. At the same
time, we need to get to the root of the problem, which is not about book
lengths but the larger educational system. We can't let tests control how
teachers teach: Close reading may be easy to measure, but it's not the way to
get kids to fall in love with storytelling.
</blockquote>

If the educational system is one culprit, some may suggest that its emphasis on
testing hinders not only teaching reading but also that of history, math, and
science—what's the point of blindly memorizing facts or mechanically solving
equations as if Google or calculators don't exist when soon after graduation
students with the grace of natural amnesia forget their classroom lessons with
jaw-dropping haste, their only takeaway a bitter recollection of how learning
is not fun or satisfying? This is an interesting question, but this topic is
beyond the scope of this post. An extension of the question: what's the point
of reading a book if it leaves so scant an impact that the reader forgets about
it a few months, or even a few days, later? I don't have the answer, but let's
return briefly to Woolf's HOW SHOULD ONE READ A BOOK?:
<blockquote>
In the first place, I want to emphasize the note of interrogation at the end of
my title. Even if I could answer the question for myself, the answer would
apply only to me and not to you. The only advice, indeed, that one person can
give another about reading is to take no advice, to follow your own instincts,
to use your own reason, to come to your own conclusions . . . To admit
authorities, however heavily furrowed and gowned, into our libraries and let
them tell us how to read, what to read, what value to place upon what we read,
is to destroy the spirit of freedom which is the breath of those sanctuaries.
Everywhere else we may be bound by laws and conventions—there we have none.
</blockquote>

Or, alternatively, Kazuo Ishiguro says:
<blockquote>
I've been emphasising here the small and the private, because essentially that's
what my work is about. One person writing in a quiet room, trying to connect
with another person, reading in another quiet—or maybe not so quiet—room.
Stories can entertain, sometimes teach or argue a point, but for me the
essential thing is that they communicate feelings, that they appeal to what we
share as human beings across our borders and divides. There are large glamorous
industries around stories: the book industry, the movie industry, the
television industry, the theatre industry. But in the end, stories are about
one person saying to another: This is the way it feels to me. Can you
understand what I'm saying? Does it also feel this way to you?
</blockquote>

Long-form writing, whether in a novel or critical essay, if it is to have value
beyond the author's monologue, must hold it own. If it cannot, it is not long
for this world, and nor should it be. What does the novel as a medium offer
which others do not that warrants its continued existence? The novel lacks the
flowing melodies of music and the visual splendors of film and the dramatic
delivery of a speech by a flesh-and-blood actor on stage—the novel is,
truthfully, a bland affair of printed, flat words on a stale page, often
ensconced in a thick tome of yawning intimidation. Novelists, and poets too,
have just one tool at their disposal: words—and through words must flow in
worlds and images, music and silence, company and solitude, reveries and
quietude and rambunctious dissipation—all the while remaining approachable,
humble, accessible, amusing to the sensibilities yet sober, penetrating,
relatable, grounded in reality, unveiling insights as only a novel can, that
which is unable to be found anywhere else. Death, then, to the novels unable to
do so. The modern novelist is tasked with the burden of handling not only the
competition from other novels but also the more immediate gratifications from
other mediums, to use words to keep all else at bay, to say: words alone must
suffice.

David Foster Wallace mentioned a few interesting ideas when he said:
<blockquote>
Let me insert one thing, which I'll bet you've noticed from talking to writers,
is that most of the stuff we think we're writing about in books is very
difficult to talk about straight out, you know, question-and-answer, and in
some sense it probably can't be talked about directly, and that's why people
make up stories about it.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The idea of being a citizen would be to understand your country's history and
the things about it that are good and not so good and how the system works, and
taking the trouble to learn about candidates running for office . . . When
people don't do that, here's what happens. The candidates win who have the most
money to buy television advertisements because television advertisements are
all most voters know about the candidates. Therefore, we get candidates who are
beholden to large donors and become, in some ways, corrupt, which disgusts the
voters and makes the voters even less interested in politics, less willing to
do the work of citizenship . . . Talking about this now, I feel ashamed,
because my saying all this sounds like an older person saying this like a
person lecturing, which in American culture sets me up to be ridiculed. It
would be very easy to make fun of what I'm saying, and I can hear in my head a
voice making fun of this stuff as I'm saying it. And this is the kind of
paradox, I think, of what it is to be a halfway intelligent American right now
and probably also a Western European. There are things we know are right and
good and would be better for us to do, but constantly it's like, 'Yeah, but
it's so much funnier and nicer to go do something else, and who cares? It's all
bullshit anyway.' . . .  The paradox is that sort of tension and complication
and conflict in people also make them very easy to market to, because I can say
to you, 'Feeling uneasy? Life feels empty? Here's something you can buy or
something you can go do.'

There's probably more demand for serious books in Europe, but here there's a
small pocket of probably, I don't know, half a million, say a million readers,
many of whom are from the upper classes and have good educations and have been
taught the pleasures of hard work in reading or music or art and like that. I
mean, when you're talking to me, you're talking to someone who doesn't have
very much power in the culture and who's not very important except in a fairly
small—I don't know what the analogue would be. It would be something like
contemporary classical music in the U.S., which there are people who enjoy it
and listen to it, partly because of training and partly because they are
disposed to be willing to do a certain amount more work reading it. But
compared to popular music and rock and roll and hip-hop and stuff, classical
music is nothing, economically or commercially or in terms of how many people
have heard of it or how much an influence it has on the culture . . . I think
in the U.S., people who have been doing serious stuff, which is harder and
stranger, have always played to a much smaller audience . . . Reading requires
sitting alone in a quiet room, and I have friends, intelligent friends, who
don't like to read—it's not just bored—there's an almost dread that comes up
here about having to be alone and having to be quiet. And you see that when you
walk into most public spaces in America, it isn't quiet anymore. They pipe
music through, and the music is easy to make fun of because it's usually really
horrible music, but it seems significant that we don't want things to be quiet
ever anymore. And to me, I don't know if I can defend it, but that seems to me
to have something to do with, when you feel like the purpose of your life is to
gratify yourself and get things for yourself and go all the time, there's this
other part of you that's almost hungry for silence and quiet and thinking
really hard about the same thing for half an hour instead of thirty seconds,
that doesn't get fed at all . . . I think it's true that here in the U.S. every
year the culture gets more and more hostile. It becomes more and more difficult
to ask people to read, or to look at a piece of art for an hour, or to listen
to a piece of music that's complicated and that takes work to understand.

In the United States, there is another divison, between corporate publishers
and non-profit publishers, who are often very small and do a lot of poetry and
avant-garde fiction. If you are 'lucky' enough to be published by a corporate
publisher, you get more exposure, you get reviewed in the New York Times
instead of just in your local paper, you get translated into other languages,
but literary stuff loses money for corporate publishers almost all the time,
and one of the ways they try to keep from losing money is marketing the
stuff—having the author go around and talk and read—the thing they most like to
do is send you to a bookstore and you give a reading . . . and that generates
free advertising for the book.
</blockquote>

Sally Rooney's take on it:
<blockquote>
Writers turn up to events full of people from a particular class, with a
particular educational background, and essentially the writer sells them the
product which is cultured existence in the form of a commodity, and the
commodity is a book. And people can purchase this book and therefore purchase
their way into a seemingly cultured class. And all the money that changes hands
in the book industry is actually just people paying to belong to a class of
people who read books.
</blockquote>

David Foster Wallace goes on:
<blockquote>
When there's a question-and-answer at the end of a reading, the question is
easy to answer if it's dull or stupid. The good questions are the questions that
can't be answered in a Q-and-A format. They're ones you have to sit down with a
pot of tea or a pot of coffee. They are things that can only be answered in
conversation between two people, and so I always feel vaguely fraudulent . . .
It makes me nervous and self-conscious to try to talk about stuff that I find
almost impossible to talk about, or else to just go, 'So how long are you in
town?'—'Oh, three days.' . . . The whole going around and reading in bookstores
thing, it's turning writers into penny-ante or cheap versions of celebrities.
People aren't usually coming out to hear you read. They're coming to see what
you look like and see whether your voice matches the voice that's in their head
when they read, and it's all—none of it is important.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If you do work like this, you pay certain prices. You don't make as much money,
not as many people read your stuff, but the people who are reading it and are
interested in it—the thing I like about doing this kind of stuff is that I'm
pretty sure my readers are about as smart as I am. I think if you're someone
like Crichton or someone who's a Harvard M.D. but you're writing for a mass
audience, things get very strange. I don't worry that people who are reading my
stuff are misunderstanding it or banalizing it . . . This is something else
about being an American. When I hear 'existential' now, half of me rolls my
eyes—'Oh, what a big sexy philosophical term.' And it becomes hard to speak
seriously about it because all I can hear is being made fun of how serious and
boring and dull I'm being.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I know that there's a paradox in the U.S. of, the people who get powerful jobs
tend to go to really good schools, and often in school you study the liberal
arts, which is philosophy, classical stuff, languages, and it's all very much
about the nobility of the human spirit and broadening the mind. And then from
that, you go to a specialized school to learn how to sue people or to figure
out how to write copy that will make people buy a certain kind of SUV . . . I'm
not sure really that it's ever been all that different. There are things about
my job that I don't like, but this is one of them I do like, is that I get to
use everything I've ever learned or think about . . . I know that there is, at
least in America, an entire class of—and now I'm talking about a very specific
class here—I'm talking about upper and upper-middle class kids whose parents
could afford to send them to very good schools where they got very good
educations, who are often working in jobs that are financially rewarding but
don't have anything to do with they got taught was important and worthwhile in
school.

<blockquote>
What it seems like here is that, television and corporate entertainment,
because it's so expensive, in order to make money it has to appeal to a very
wide audience. Which means it has to find things that a lot of people have in
common. What most of us have in common here are our very most base,
uninteresting, selfish, stupid interests—physical attractiveness, sex, a
certain kind of easy humor, vivid spectacle. That's stuff I will immediately
look at, and so will you. So it's in our very most base and childish interests
that make us a mass. The things that make us interesting and unique and human,
those interests tend to be wildly different between different people.
</blockquote>

David Foster Wallace said this in 2003. Not much has changed, and nor will it,
but indeed he suspected correctly that things have never really been all that
different. In 1880, Dostoyevsky wrote in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV:

<blockquote>
Taking freedom to mean the increase and prompt satisfaction of needs,
[people] distort their own nature, for they generate many meaningless and
foolish desires, habits, and the most absurd fancies in themselves. They live
only for mutual envy, for pleasure-seeking and self-display. To have dinners,
horses, carriages, rank, and slaves to serve them is now considered such a
necessity that for the sake of it, to satisfy it, they will sacrifice life,
honor, the love of mankind, and will even kill themselves if they are unable to
satisfy it . . . I ask you: is such a man free? . . . And therefore the idea of
serving mankind, of the brotherhood and oneness of people, is fading more and
more in the world, and indeed the idea now even meets with mockery, for how can
one drop one's habits, where will this slave go now that he is so accustomed to
satisfying the innumerable needs he himself has invented? He is isolated, and
what does he care about the whole? They have succeeded in amassing more and
more things, but have less and less joy.
</blockquote>

I'll now switch to politics. This first paragraph is directed not at sensible,
well-meaning Republicans but those who follow and agree with Tucker Carlson and
Laura Ingraham. Republicans, scream election fraud all you want; two can play
that game. Populists, if you are so wary of intellectuals, to science, to
thinking and evidence, do you go to the dentist when you have a toothache? To
the hospital when you have cancer? Trusting intellectuals is not socialism.
Physical distancing and wearing masks during a global pandemic caused by an
airborne virus is not socialism. Raising taxes on the rich is not socialism.
The personal income tax, corporate tax, and estate tax are not socialism. If
you think higher taxes for the rich also means higher taxes for struggling
farmers, you've been duped by people who sell their agenda by calling it your
individual liberty when they buy their islands, hide in their bunkers at the
outset of a pandemic, and, when Earth is not enough, race each other to fly to
space. How disgraceful have you become not only as a political party but as
people when you refuse to investigate an attack on your own Capitol? Consider
for a moment the possibility that those you revile as intellectuals spend
considerable time thinking about problems you yourself do not, and sometimes
facing truth requires putting aside blind national pride. How is it possible
with all the knowledge and advancements of modernity we have in America a
movement steeped in
<a href="https://www.studioatao.org/post/understanding-anti-intellectualism-in-the-u-s">anti-intellectualism</a>?
Let me get to the point. Religious fundamentalists teach distrust towards
intellectuals to silence alternative worldviews in an increasingly secular
society where they are losing power as their followers, becoming
self-sufficient, break away. And what happens when anti-intellectualism is
taken to the extreme? History offers a few data points. In 1915, Ottomans,
fearing Armenian independence, began their genocide first with the
intellectuals to remove leadership. In the 1960s Mao launched the Cultural
Revolution in China in which for a full decade academics, scientists,
professors, and any intellectual ranging from those employed in the
institutions down to recent college graduates, all associated with the
bourgeois, were implicated and were marched in public in humiliation, beaten,
killed, or sent to work on farms, and schools and universities were closed,
sending scholarship and literacy down a monumental backslide in a country that
had for many centuries prized education, all to consolidate power for himself
in the name of glorifying the people, whose descendants now are more drawn to
material excess than the humility of the long time prior. We in American have
not yet descended so low, but when the people elect someone who withdraws from
the WHO, seriously considers pulling out of NATO, promises to revive the coal
industry, and repeatedly disregards the recommendations of scientists during a
global pandemic, do we suppose we are heading in the right direction? In
antiquity, Plato advocated for a philosopher king, and through all the progress
we've made since then we've come to be threatened by duplicitous capitalists
appealing to irrational fear and incompetence. After the Capitol rioters
succeeded in seizing the building, looting and destroying, they meandered
about, having ridden the tide of hysteria and rage to find themselves without
any idea what to do next, pawns to someone afraid of losing power.

I'll now talk reasonably. This section talks about taxes and also, because this
topic relates to wealth, politics. Full disclosure: I'm not an economist or a
tax lawyer, nor do I believe I'm going to change anyone's views on this. The
question of whether the rich are already being taxed enough seems nearly as
difficult as the question of whether a God or gods exist. You already have an
answer you believe in, and what you see will either confirm your position or
raise your suspicion at its correctness. For those who like me are not experts
in tax research and who are interested in my side, which calls for equitable
redistribution of resources, the notable researchers are these French
economists:
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q_E5lH4AAAAJ&hl=en">Thomas Piketty</a>,
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qZpr_CQAAAAJ&hl=en">Emmanuel Saez</a>,
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GbOivREAAAAJ&hl=en">Gabriel Zucman</a>.
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PhDDPiUAAAAJ&hl=en">Raj Chetty</a>
also does promising and very interesting work on the country's inequality and
unequal access to opportunity. But case in point on the difficulty of the tax
question: in 2011 Saez, with Nobel laureate Peter Diamond, calculated that the
optimal tax rate for the highest income bracket in the U.S. is
<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.25.4.165">73%</a>.
Currently, it is
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/publications/federal-tax-rates-and-tax-brackets/#brackets">37%</a>.
The principle behind this high rate is optimal tax theory, which aims to
maximize everyone's well-being without inhibiting innovation. For comparison,
AOC's proposed tax rate is 70% on—this is key—only income higher than $10
million. The great majority of American families do not reach that threshold.
Then, a paper like
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2550936">this</a>
points out the logistical impracticalities of raising taxes.
And
<a href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/optimal-top-tax-rates-review-critique">this</a>
from Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, modifies two parameters in the
model. The author writes of the original paper, "They argued that, if the
Pareto parameter is 1.5 and the ETI is 0.25, then 'τ* = 1/(1 + 1.5 × 0.25) = 73
percent'. If that formula is accepted uncritically, then the conclusion follows
from the premises. But neither the formula itself, nor the two parameters
(Pareto and elasticity) need be accepted uncritically. If this was a recipe for
baking a cake, it might be prudent to question both the recipe and the
ingredients." The author also writes, "with empirically credible changes in
parameters, the Diamond‐Saez formula can more easily be used to show that top
U.S. federal, state, and local tax rates are already too high rather than too
low." However, the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank
supports the high rate,
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-income-taxes/">writing</a>,
"The policy implications of this research are that increasing top marginal tax
rates can raise substantial sums of revenue and potentially dampen the rise of
income inequality without unduly restraining economic growth." I think this
kind of disagreement is ridiculous. For comparison, even though machine
learning research has a lot of bloat and myriad models, parameters, and
modifications to explore, at the end of the day there is consensus on a model's
performance because researchers don't question the evaluation metrics. But when
it comes to taxes, because money is involved, where a right-leaning think tank
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/rich-pay-their-fair-share-of-taxes/">says</a>
the rich are already paying their fair share, a left-leaning one has
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/decades-of-rising-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s-testimony-before-the-u-s-house-of-representatives-ways-and-means-committee/#share">data</a>
suggesting they don't. Opposing
<a href="https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/1-chart-how-much-the-rich-pay-taxes">these</a>
facts are also
<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-fairness-briefing-booklet/fact-sheet-corporate-tax-rates/">these</a>.
And what does the public think? One
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/04/growing-partisan-divide-over-fairness-of-the-nations-tax-system/">poll</a>
shows 60% of Americans say that it bothers them a lot that some wealthy people
don't pay their fair share, and that views on the country's tax system is
increasingly colored by political affiliation.

I think the interesting question isn't: Are the rich paying their fair share of
income taxes? but rather: Why is inequality still rising when the rich are
already paying so much? By "so much", I mean the fact that in 2018 the top 1%,
according to the two conservatives' links at the end of the paragraph above, the
numbers also corroborated by another Tax Foundation
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/publications/latest-federal-income-tax-data/">article</a>,
earned 21% of all income but paid 40% of federal income taxes, and the top 10%
earned 48% of the income but paid 71% of the taxes. Before I go further, I
think it's important to put these numbers in perspective. Using a flat rate for
simplicity, taxing 20% on someone making $100,000 does not have the same effect
on the standard of living as 20% on someone making $10,000,000, which would
produce a much larger share of the taxes between the two. I think the answer to
this question: Do the rich pay their fair share of income taxes? is: yes. But
this is not the right question because income is only part of the picture. You
might wonder how inequality is still rising if the wealthy pay their fair share
of income taxes. Conservatives are hesitant to talk about the other variable:
existing wealth. The real equation of annual net worth growth is:

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white; text-align:center;">
net worth growth = income + wealth growth - debt growth
</pre>

where

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
income = salary, wages, interest, dividends, etc.
wealth growth = stock appreciation, real estate appreciation, etc.
</pre>

Among the rich, wealth growth dominates. I'm going to focus on wealth growth
from stocks which, in our current system, favors those who already own them,
and those with more shares benefit disproportionately from rising values and
begin to own more and more, i.e. the game is rigged. Piketty wrote a more
complete discussion on this kind of growing inequality in CAPITAL IN THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. Piketty traced the history of wealth and inequality and
observed that when investment growth alone outpaces the rest of the economy,
the inevitable end is rising inequality. His recommended solution is a
progressive wealth tax, which is what I also believe in. It is crucial to keep
in mind that the wealth tax is separate from the income tax most people are
familiar with. The wealth tax is imposed on already acquired wealth which for
the rich is the main instrument for wealth growth, a method that is out of
reach of most Americans. The U.S. has never had a wealth tax, and it is not
hard to imagine who might go to extraordinary lengths to prevent one and why
they might call it unconstitutional.

In 2019, the Federal Reserve released a
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019017pap.pdf">paper</a>
describing the rising wealth inequality:
<blockquote>
At the highest level, the [Distributed Financial Accounts] show significant
wealth concentration and a clear increase in wealth concentration since
1989 . . . In 2018, the top 10% of U.S. households controlled 70 percent of
total household wealth, up from 60 percent in 1989. The share of the top 1% of
the wealth distribution increased from 23 percent to nearly 32 percent from
1989 to 2018. The increase in the wealth share of the top 10% came at the
expense of households in the 50th to 90th percentiles of the wealth
distribution, whose share decreased from 36 percent to 29 percent over this
period . . . [T]he bottom 50% of the wealth distribution experienced virtually
no increase in their nominal net worth over the last 30 years, resulting in a
fall in total wealth share from 4 percent in 1989 to just 1 percent in 2018.
The rise in wealth concentration stems primarily from increased concentration
of assets . . . with trends for assets largely mimicking those for overall
wealth. The share of assets held by the top 10% of the wealth distribution rose
from 55 percent to 64 percent since 1989, with asset shares increasing the most
for the top 1% of households. These increases were mirrored by decreases for
households in the 50-90th percentiles of the wealth distribution . . .
[W]e observe that the share of real estate held by the top 10% of the wealth
distribution has increased by 5 percentage points from 39 percent to 44
percent, suggesting that increases in wealthy households' share of real estate
holdings have contributed to the increase in concentration . . . [C]orporate and
noncorporate business equity have been large drivers of wealth concentration.
The distribution of these assets has long been skewed: in 1989, the richest 10%
of households held 80 percent of corporate equity and 78 percent of equity in
noncorporate business. Since 1989, the top 10%'s share of corporate equity has
increased, on net, from 80 percent to 87 percent, and their share of
noncorporate business equity has increased, on net, from 78 percent to 86
percent. Furthermore, most of these increases in business equity holdings have
been realized by the top 1%, whose corporate equity shares increased from 39
percent to 50 percent and noncorporate equity shares increased from 42 percent
to 53 percent since 1989.

The paper contains charts of the data, but it's easier to go to an
interactive version for the
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WFRBST01122,WFRBSN09149,WFRBSN40176,WFRBSB50203">stock dataset</a>
from the Federal Reserve's database. We see that stocks are predominantly owned
by the wealthy, and their share has grown in the last 30 years. The share
among the top 10% in Q1 1991 was 79.7% and rose in Q1 2021 to 88.7%. We also
see that since at least as far back as 1989, the bottom 50% have never owned
more than 1.8% and in 2021 owned 0.6%, which is next to nothing. Another
dataset shows the
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WFRBST01134,WFRBSN09161,WFRBSN40188,WFRBSB50215">net worth distribution</a>,
and the same pattern emerges. The share among the top 10% in Q1 1991 was 60.3%
and rose in Q1 2021 to 69.8%. The bottom 50% never owned more than 4.3% since
1989 and in 2021 owned a mere 2%. The Pew Research Center also has
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/psdt_01-10-20_economic-inequality_1-4/">data</a>
showing the growing wealth inequality. When we also account for wealth, the
question "Do the rich pay their fair share?" takes on a different meaning. The
income tax numbers that conservatives toss about are only skirting around the
issue. That the top 10% earned 48% of one year's income but paid 71% of the
year's taxes no longer puts the burden on the poor when we see that the bottom
50% have almost nothing to tax. According to the Tax Policy Center,
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-fact/income-salaries-and-wages-ff-06212021">the portion of income</a>
from salaries and wages also diverges by income class. For households with an
adjusted gross income less than $500,000, most (71%-81%) of the income came
from salaries and wages—from working. For households whose AGI is at least $10
million, that portion shrinks to 17%. The majority of their income likely comes
from bond interest and dividends—from their wealth by either investing or
owning shares of their own company. Inequality also plays out in college
admissions. An
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">article</a>
from The Times visualizes data from a study co-authored by Raj Chetty and Saez,
finding that:
<blockquote>
At 38 colleges in America, including five in the Ivy League . . . more
students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire
bottom 60 percent. Roughly one in four of the richest students attend an elite
college – universities that typically cluster toward the top of annual
rankings. In contrast, less than one-half of 1 percent of children from the
bottom fifth of American families attend an elite college; less than half
attend any college at all.
</blockquote>

It is important to distinguish between groups within the top 1%, which has its
own massive internal inequalities. The Chicago Booth Review has an
<a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent">article</a>
that differentiates the average income in 2015 between four segments in the top
1% (0.5%-1%, 0.1%-0.5%, 0.01%-0.1%, and the top 0.01%), and even in this
echelon, the wealthier acquire wealth faster; each step from one group to its
next higher group is a jump on an exponential curve, from $485 thousand to $901
thousand to $2.9 million to $18.9 million. The richest group, the 0.01%, are
the 1 percenters of the 1 percent. Inequality.org gives a more concrete look at
the wealthy, splitting the top 10% into five groups and gave a brief
descriptive
<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/taxing-rich-starts-knowing-who-they-are/">profile</a>
of each one. One investment manager suggests that there is a large divide
between the bottom and top halves of the top 1%. In 2011 he
<a href="https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/investment_manager.html">emailed</a>
Bill Domhoff at WHO RULES AMERICA? the trouble he saw in the economy's
inequality, particularly as caused by the top 0.5%. He remained anonymous to
protect his identity since his clients are primarily the ones he is
criticizing, as they "largely fall into the top 1%, have a net worth of
$5,000,000 or above, and — if working — make over $300,000 per year." He writes
of the lower half:
<blockquote>
The 99th to 99.5th percentiles largely include physicians, attorneys, upper
middle management, and small business people who have done well . . . The net
worth for those in the lower half of the top 1% is usually achieved after
decades of education, hard work, saving and investing as a professional or
small business person. While an after-tax income of $175k to $250k and net
worth in the $1.2M to $1.8M range may seem like a lot of money to most
Americans, it doesn't really buy freedom from financial worry or access to the
true corridors of power and money. That doesn't become frequent until we reach
the top 0.1% . . . Our poor lower half of the top 1% lives well but has some
financial worries. Since the majority of those in this group actually earned
their money from professions and smaller businesses, they generally don't
participate in the benefits big money enjoys. Those in the 99th to 99.5th
percentile lack access to power . . . Unlike those in the lower half of the top
1%, those in the top half and, particularly, top 0.1%, can often borrow for
almost nothing, keep profits and production overseas, hold personal assets in
tax havens, ride out down markets and economies, and influence legislation in
the U.S. They have access to the very best in accounting firms, tax and other
attorneys, numerous consultants, private wealth managers, a network of other
wealthy and powerful friends, lucrative business opportunities, and many other
benefits. Most of those in the bottom half of the top 1% lack power and global
flexibility and are essentially well-compensated workhorses for the top 0.5%,
just like the bottom 99%. In my view, the American dream of striking it rich is
merely a well-marketed fantasy that keeps the bottom 99.5% hoping for better
and prevents social and political instability. The odds of getting into that
top 0.5% are very slim and the door is kept firmly shut by those within it.
</blockquote>
The investment manager then describes the upper half:
<blockquote>
Membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some
aspect of the financial services or banking industry, real estate development
involved with those industries, or government contracting. Some hard working
and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as $15M-$20M before
retirement but they are rare. Those in the top 0.5% have incomes over $500k if
working and a net worth over $1.8M if retired. The higher we go up into the top
0.5% the more likely it is that their wealth is in some way tied to the
investment industry and borrowed money than from personally selling goods or
services or labor as do most in the bottom 99.5%. They are much more likely to
have built their net worth from stock options and capital gains in stocks and
real estate and private business sales, not from income which is taxed at a
much higher rate. These opportunities are largely unavailable to the bottom
99.5% . . . The picture is clear; entry into the top 0.5% and, particularly,
the top 0.1% is usually the result of some association with the financial
industry and its creations. I find it questionable as to whether the majority
in this group actually adds value or simply diverts value from the US economy
and business into its pockets and the pockets of the uber-wealthy who hire
them. They are, of course, doing nothing illegal . . . A highly complex set of
laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the
uppermost reaches of the U.S. financial system. It allows them to protect and
increase their wealth and significantly affect the U.S. political and
legislative processes. They have real power and real wealth. Ordinary citizens
in the bottom 99.9% are largely not aware of these systems, do not understand
how they work, are unlikely to participate in them, and have little likelihood
of entering the top 0.5%, much less the top 0.1%. Moreover, those at the very
top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules. I am not
optimistic.

In a 2014 addendum, the investment manager wrote:
<blockquote>
One might think that physicians, America's highest-paid professional group,
would be largely exempt from the economic currents affecting most other
Americans. This isn't so. Medscape, a key physician website, reports that as of
2013, mean income for male physicians in all specialties was $259k; for female
physicians, it was $199k. Family practice doctors and internists earned the
least, averaging around $175k. Orthopedic surgeons earned the most, averaging
around $405k; they are the only physician specialty falling within the top 1%
by income . . . If our hypothetical physician saves and invests for 35 years,
he will have contributed less than $2 million dollars to retirement plans . . .
Thus, an average physician — while doing very well by most people's standards —
is unlikely to earn or accumulate enough to place him or her in the top 1% by
income or net worth at the end of their career. Opportunity for most Americans,
even physicians, is decreasing, even while net worth and income accelerate for
those at the very top of the system. If an average physician today is unlikely
to make it into the top 1% (Piketty and Saez's end-of-2012 data show that the
1% income line is crossed with an income of $396k per year), then it seems
pretty clear that crossing that line via income, savings, and investments will
be impossible for nearly every American in the future.

He wrote also about someone who put up with finance enough to retire early, and
her account of investment banking reminded me of academia, only the currency
there is not money, and there's not so much as damage to anything as a large
part of it will never see the light of day and has no other purpose than
publication:
<blockquote>
Recently, I spoke with a younger client who retired from a major
investment bank in her early thirties, net worth around $8M. Since I knew she
held a critical view of investment banking, I asked if her colleagues talked
about or understood how much damage was created in the broader economy from
their activities. Her answer was that no one talks about it in public but
almost all understood and were unbelievably cynical, hoping to exit the system
when they became rich enough.

What does net worth growth look like for those in the highest echelon? Let's
look at Stephen Schwarzman's in 2020. I have nothing personal against
Schwarzman; he has a history of philanthropy, and he's signed The Giving
Pledge. I'm just using his wealth as an example. According to Reuters,
Schwarzman
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackstone-group-ceo-compensation/blackstone-ceo-schwarzman-took-home-610-5-million-in-2020-idUSKBN2AT2V7">received</a>
$86.4 million in compensation and $524.1 million in dividends from his
Blackstone shares, for a total income of at least $610.5 million. What about
his wealth growth, considering solely his earnings from Blackstone? According
to the same link, he owns 19.3% of Blackstone, which had
<a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/BX/shares_outstanding">682.91 million</a>
shares outstanding in 2/2020, so he owned 131.8 million shares. Using stock
price
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BX/">data</a>
from Yahoo Finance:

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">

</pre>

Forbes
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/stephen-schwarzman/?sh=ffc2fea234a2">shows</a>
his net worth in 4/2020 was $15.4 billion and rose to $19.1 billion in 9/2020,
so he has more earnings than from Blackstone alone. Because the government does
not tax wealth, it is only when Schwarzman sells his shares that his earnings
get taxed. If Schwarzman holds on to his shares for at least a year, which he
already has, he avoids paying the higher rates of the ordinary income
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#brackets">tax brackets</a>
(10%-37%) and gets charged the
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#capgains">lower rates</a>
(0%-20%) of long-term capital gains. But what happens if Schwarzman doesn't sell
his stocks? From a recent ProPublica
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">report</a>:
<blockquote>
The notion of dying as a tax benefit seems paradoxical. Normally when someone
sells an asset, even a minute before they die, they owe 20% capital gains tax.
But at death, that changes. Any capital gains till that moment are not taxed.
This allows the ultrarich and their heirs to avoid paying billions in taxes.
The 'step-up in basis' is widely recognized by experts across the political
spectrum as a flaw in the code.
</blockquote>
Dividends from stocks, however, do count as taxable income, but investors can
avoid that burden by choosing companies that reinvest in themselves rather than
pay dividends; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway does not pay dividends. If
the rich avoid receiving income, how do they pay for their large purchases?
I've not yet mentioned the third variable in the net worth growth equation:
debt. It turns out that if you're ultrawealthy, you can borrow money to avoid
taxes. According to the same ProPublica report:
<blockquote>
For regular people, borrowing money is often something done out of necessity,
say for a car or a home. But for the ultrawealthy, it can be a way to access
billions without producing income, and thus, income tax. The tax math provides
a clear incentive for this. If you own a company and take a huge salary, you'll
pay 37% in income tax on the bulk of it. Sell stock and you'll pay 20% in
capital gains tax — and lose some control over your company. But take out a
loan, and these days you'll pay a single-digit interest rate and no tax; since
loans must be paid back, the IRS doesn't consider them income. Banks typically
require collateral, but the wealthy have plenty of that.

Abigail Disney, an heiress of the Disney family, is among the exceptions in
America's aristocrats in that she has a conscience to admit the failings of the
system. She
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/abigail-disney-rich-protect-dynastic-wealth-propublica-tax/619212/">writes</a>
in The Atlantic a response to the ProPublica report:
<blockquote>
Nowhere does ProPublica assert that these men cheated, lied, or did anything
felonious to lower their tax burdens. The naked fact of the matter is that not
a single one of the documented methods and practices that allowed these
billionaires to so radically minimize their tax obligations was illegal. What's
worse, these methods and practices—things such as offsetting income with losses
in unrelated businesses; structuring assets to grow rather than generate
income, then borrowing against those growing assets for cash needs; and
deducting interest payments and state taxes from taxable income—are so
downright mundane and commonly applied that most rich people don't see them as
unethical. The more interesting question is not how the men in ProPublica's
report were able to avoid paying much or anything in federal income taxes, but
why. What motivates people with so much money to try to withhold every last bit
of it from the public's reach? . . . Having money—a lot of money—is very, very
nice. It's damn hard to resist the seductions of what money buys you. I've
never been much of a materialist, but I have wallowed in the less concrete
privileges that come with a trust fund, such as time, control, security,
attention, power, and choice. The fact is, this is pretty standard software
that comes with the hardware of a human body. As time has passed, I have
realized that the dynamics of wealth are similar to the dynamics of addiction.
The more you have, the more you need. Whereas once a single beer was enough to
achieve a feeling of calm, now you find that you can't stop at six. Likewise,
if you move up from coach to business to first class, you won't want to go back
to coach. And once you've flown private, wild horses will never drag you
through a public airport terminal again. Comforts, once gained, become
necessities. And if enough of those comforts become necessities, you eventually
peel yourself away from any kind of common feeling with the rest of humanity.
The older I've gotten and the more clearly I've understood these things, the
more the impulse to betray my own class has taken charge of my judgment. What's
shocking about the ProPublica report is not just that the tax bills are so low,
but that these billionaires can live with themselves.

Abigail Disney also references David Foster Wallace's THIS IS WATER commencement
speech in 2005 at Kenyon College: "All I know is that if you are a fish, it is
hard to describe water, much less to ask if water is necessary, ethical, and
structured the way it ought to be."

To an average American family earning $70,000 a year, an additional $10,000
makes a sizable impact. To someone in this stratosphere, an additional million
or two makes no meaningful difference. In the end, there are two choices for
the ultrawealthy: 1) signing
<a href="https://givingpledge.org/">The Giving Pledge</a>
to give to charity most of the fortunes made in their lifetimes by their own
accomplishment, which Schwarzman and Buffett have done, and 2) starting a new
capitalist dynasty like these
<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-richest-families-in-america/">families</a>
whose heirs know it is best to stay away from the limelight, instead protecting
their wealth by calling for lower taxes and lobbying in various forms, such as
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/estatetaxfinal.pdf">repealing</a>
the estate tax, calling it the death tax to scare the common American to whom
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-many-people-pay-estate-tax">the tax would never apply</a>.

The wealth tax isn't a new idea; it's already been proposed in politics. Bernie
Sanders
<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/">proposes</a>
a wealth tax that would:
<blockquote>
only apply to net worth of over $32 million and anyone who has a net worth of
less than $32 million, would not see their taxes go up at all under this
plan . . . This tax on extreme wealth would have a progressive rate structure
that would only apply to the wealthiest 180,000 households in America who are
in the top 0.1 percent. It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above
$32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5
million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000. The tax rate would increase to 2
percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500
million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5
billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion,
and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for
singles. Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over
15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and
power of this small privileged class.
</blockquote>
This last sentence, of course, would not make the referenced class happy.
Elizabeth Warren's more lenient
<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax">version</a>
of the wealth tax raises the minimum threshold at which the tax starts and has
lower rates: "Zero additional tax on any household with a net worth of less
than $50 million (99.9% of American households)." The tax for the wealthy
is: "2% annual tax on household net worth between $50 million and $1 billion",
and for billionaires: "4% annual Billionaire Surtax (6% tax overall) on
household net worth above $1 billion". Furthermore, research suggests that more
equitable distribution of economic growth leads to more opportunity for all.
Raj Chetty
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6336/398.full">found</a>
that:
<blockquote>
rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children
born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates
experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP
growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would
reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that
reviving the 'American dream' of high rates of absolute mobility would require
economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.
</blockquote>
We have data that confirm that taxes successfully redistribute income and reduce
inequality. Our World in Data
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality#redistribution-through-tax-and-transfer-policies">visualized</a>
income distributions before and after taxes, as they currently stand, for
multiple countries and found that "inequality is not only reduced by
redistribution between individuals at a given point in time, but also by
achieving redistribution over the course of life." OWID also has an
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-inequality-gini-index?tab=chart&country=USA~FRA~DNK~DEU~ISL~GBR~CHE~SWE~ITA~NOR">interactive visualization</a>
comparing inequality between the U.S. and several European countries. The U.S.
notably has the highest inequality, and lowest inequality is in the group of
Scandinavian countries which have higher taxes to support a broader system of
government services.

I should mention explicitly that I do not support socialism. It didn't work out
well for the countries that ran that experiment, but unbridled capitalism leads
to growing inequality and does not yield equal opportunity for all. Inequality
is presumed and necessary in capitalism, but what is the right level of
inequality? One
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437115003738">paper</a>
proposed that the fairest inequality is a lognormal distribution. The paper
hasn't generated much interest, and I suspect this is a hard problem, not to
mention the politics involved, so this question is not one I'm going to
explore.

I don't think the main driver of the economy relates solely to taxation, but a
classic Republican claim is that lower taxes jumpstarts the economy. I'm not
convinced. If an old-school Republican points to Reagan's economic success by
lowering taxes, I'll point out that Clinton did better
in terms of
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Presidential_Comparison_Real_GDP_-_v1.png">GDP</a>
and
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Job_Growth_by_U.S._President_-_v1.png">job growth</a> with higher taxes on the
wealthy. The Federal Reserve has job growth
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USPRIV">data</a>
since 1939 in absolute terms. Clinton did
<a href="https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/textonly/WH/Accomplishments/Small_Business.html">lower taxes</a>
for businesses, but it was for small businesses, not the wealthy. It certainly
wasn't a trickle-down utopia. And Mike Pence recently
<a href="https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/bidens-china-first-tax-plan-americans-come-last-presidents-jobs-plan">wrote</a>:
<blockquote>
Under the Trump-Pence administration, we proved that low taxes are the key to
creating prosperity for Americans of every background and income group. In
2017, we passed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which delivered more than
$3.2 trillion in tax relief to American families and businesses. Within months,
our economy took off like a rocket. America gained more than 7 million new
jobs, unemployment plummeted to the lowest rate in 50 years, and more than 10
million people were lifted off of welfare—the largest reduction in poverty in
modern history.
</blockquote>
Actually, they didn't prove anything. The two job growth links above put Pence's
claims in context. In addition, we can compare Trump's numbers and Obama's.
FactCheck.org
<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/obamas-final-numbers/">summarized</a>
the numbers at the end of Obama's
term: "The economy gained a net 11.6 million jobs. The unemployment rate
dropped to below the historical norm." The numbers Pence mentions were not caused by Trump's
TCJA. The unemployment rate data
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE">show</a>
that by the time Trump took office, unemployment was already in decline, a trend
Obama started when he became president in 2009 immediately after the recession.
If Trump improved on Obama's performance, we would see a steep drop in
unemployment starting in 2017, but we don't. Again, Trump's TCJA didn't prove
anything. What about Biden's tax proposal? Lately there's been a lot of
intimidating news about it, with some calling it outright socialism. I will not
give them more coverage by linking to them, but Biden's tax hike is not
socialism. According to the Tax Foundation's
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/biden-tax-plan-tracker/">Biden tax tracker</a>,
Biden's tax hike to fund his infrastructure plan would "raise the top marginal income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent".
How does this compare to the historic rates? The Tax Policy Center has
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates">tabulated</a>
the top marginal rate from 1913 to 2020. Biden's new rate of 39.6% is the same
as Clinton's when he was in office between 1993 and 2001. What Biden is
proposing is not socialism. For a complete listing of the tax bracket history,
the Tax Foundation has a
<a href="https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/fed_individual_rate_history_nominal.pdf">document</a>
that shows all the rates between 1913 and 2013. Furthermore, no one called the
taxes socialism in the 1950s when the top marginal rate was 91%. To be fair,
this high rate should be construed with a grain of salt because in fact the
effective tax rate for the rich was not much higher than it is these days. One
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/">analysis</a>
shows that "between 1950 and 1959, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an
average of 42.0 percent of their income in federal, state, and local taxes.
Since then, the average effective tax rate of the top 1 percent has declined
slightly overall. In 2014, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an average tax
rate of 36.4 percent." This was perhaps because few households fell into the
top bracket or simply due to tax evasion. However, my point is that even the
91% rate of the 1950s was not rampantly labeled socialism the way Biden's
proposal currently is. It's not socialism. The Tax Policy Center has also
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/biden-would-raise-taxes-substantially-high-income-households-and-corporations-cut-taxes">analyzed</a>
Biden's tax increases: "Nearly all of President Biden's proposed tax increases
would be borne by the highest income 1 percent of households—those making about
$800,000 or more . . . At the same time, Biden would cut taxes for many low-
and moderate-income households and reduce them substantially for those with
children." All the scare about impending doom sounds to me like the wealthy
don't want to pay more taxes to help relieve the country's inequality.

The idea of fixing economic inequality is only a start. This is the solution
that's obvious in light of the data, and it's what progressives push for, yet
policy changes, redistributing wealth, and improving opportunities are not
adequate solutions when we assume we understand the working class without
actually seeing their perspective and troubles. If you are reading this, you in
all likelihood are not in this class. David Shipler's THE WORKING POOR:
INVISIBLE IN AMERICA offers a profile:
<blockquote>
The man who washes cars does not own one. The clerk who files cancelled checks
at the bank has $2.02 in her account. The woman who copyedits medical textbooks
has not been to a dentist in a decade. This is the forgotten America. At the
bottom of its working world, millions live in the shadow of prosperity, in the
twilight between poverty and well-being. Whether you're rich, poor, or
middle-class, you encounter them every day . . . Those with luck or talent step
onto career ladders toward better and better positions at higher and higher
pay. Many more, however, are stuck at such low wages that their living
standards are unchanged. They still cannot save, cannot get decent health care,
cannot move to better neighborhoods, and cannot send their children to schools
that offer a promise for a successful future. These are the forgotten
Americans, who are noticed and counted as they leave welfare, but who disappear
from the nation's radar as they struggle in their working lives. Breaking away
and moving a comfortable distance from poverty seems to require a perfect
lineup of favorable conditions. A set of skills, a good starting wage, and a
job with the likelihood of promotion are prerequisites. But so are clarity of
purpose, courageous self-esteem, a lack of substantial debt, the freedom from
illness or addiction, a functional family, a network of upstanding friends, and
the right help from private or governmental agencies. Any gap in that array is
an entry point for trouble, because being poor means being unprotected. You
might as well try playing quarterback with no helmet, no padding, no training,
and no experience, behind a line of hundred-pound weaklings. With no cushion of
money, no training in the ways of the wider world, and too little defense
against the threats and temptations of decaying communities, a poor man or
woman gets sacked again and again—buffeted and bruised and defeated. When an
exception breaks this cycle of failure, it is called the fulfillment of the
American Dream . . . The working individuals in this book are neither helpless
nor omnipotent, but stand on various points along the spectrum between the
polar opposites of personal and societal responsibility. Each person's life is
the mixed product of bad choices and bad fortune, of roads not taken and roads
cut off by the accident of birth or circumstance. It is difficult to find
someone whose poverty is not somehow related to his or her unwise behavior—to
drop out of school, to have a baby out of wedlock, to do drugs, to be
chronically late to work. And it is difficult to find behavior that is not
somehow related to the inherited conditions of being poorly parented, poorly
educated, poorly housed in neighborhoods from which no distant horizon of
possiblity can been seen . . . For practically every family, then, the
ingredients of poverty are part financial and part psychological, part personal
and part societal, part past and part present. Every problem magnifies the
impact of the others, and all are so tightly interlocked that one reversal can
produce a chain reaction with results far distant from the original cause. A
run-down apartment can exacerbate a child's asthma, which leads to a call for
an ambulance, which generates a medical bill that cannot be paid, which ruins a
credit record, which hikes the interest rate on an auto loan, which forces the
purchase of an unreliable used car, which jeopardizes a mother's punctuality at
work, which limits her promotion and earning capacity, which confines her to
poor housing. If she or any other impoverished working parent added up all her
individual problems, the whole would be equal to more than the sum of its
parts.
</blockquote>
Shipler wrote this in 2004 after spending time with people living in poverty.
The people he wrote about were demographically representative, across gender
and race. A more recent book provides the view specifically into the white
working class who support Trump, and policies would not help them without
knowing their problem, that their stresses cause them to dissociate from
participation, that, for many, they cannot see it in themselves to improve.
J.D. Vance writes of Appalachia's despair in HILLBILLY ELEGY:
<blockquote>
This isn't some libertarian mistrust of government policy, which is healthy in
any democracy. This is deep skepticism of the very institutions of our society.
And it's becoming more and more mainstream. We can't trust the evening news. We
can't trust our politicians. Our universities, the gateway to a better life,
are rigged against us. We can't get jobs. You can't believe these things and
participate meaningfully in society. Social psychologists have shown that group
belief is a powerful motivator in performance. When groups perceive that it's
in their interest to work hard and achieve things, members of that group
outperform other similarly situated individuals. It's obvious why: If you
believe that hard work pays off, then you work hard; if you think it's hard to
get ahead even when you try, then why try at all? Similarly, when people do
fail, this mind-set allows them to look outward. I once ran into an old
acquaintance at a Middletown bar who told me that he had recently quit his job
because he was sick of waking up early. I later saw him complaining on Facebook
about the 'Obama economy' and how it had affected his life. I don't doubt that
the Obama economy has affected many, but this man is assuredly not among them.
His status in life is directly attributable to the choices he's made, and his
life will improve only through better decisions. But for him to make better
choices, he needs to live in an environment that forces him to ask tough
questions about himself. There is a cultural movement in the white working
class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains
adherents by the day. Here is where the rhetoric of modern conservatives (and I
say this as one of them) fails to meet the real challenges of their biggest
constituents. Instead of encouraging engagement, conservatives increasingly
foment the kind of detachment that has sapped the ambition of so many of my
peers. I have watched some friends blossom into successful adults and others
fall victim to the worst of Middletown's temptations—premature parenthood,
drugs, incarceration. What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are
the expectations that they had for their own lives. Yet the message of the
right is increasingly: It's not your fault that you're a loser; it's the
government's fault.
</blockquote>
This feeling extends to the broader white working class. Arlie Russell
Hochschild called this feeling STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LAND:
<blockquote>
You are patiently standing in a long line leading up a hill, as in a pilgrimage.
You are situated in the middle of this line, along with others who are also
white, older, Christian, predominantly male, some with college degrees, some
not. Just over the brow of the hill is the American Dream, the goal of everyone
waiting in line . . . You've suffered long hours, layoffs, and exposure to
dangerous chemicals at work, and received reduced pensions. You have shown
moral character through trial by fire, and the American Dream of prosperity and
security is a reward for all of this, showing who you have been and are—a badge
of honor . . . Look! You see people cutting in line ahead of you! You're
following the rules. They aren't. As they cut in, it feels like you are being
moved back. How can they just do that? Who are they? Some are black. Through
affirmative action plans, pushed by the federal government, they are being
given preference for places in colleges and universities, apprenticeships,
jobs, welfare payments, and free lunches . . . Women, immigrants, refugees,
public sector workers—where will it end? Your money is running through a
liberal sympathy sieve you don't control or agree with . . . But it's people
like you who have made this country great. You feel uneasy. It has to be said:
the line cutters irritate you . . . You are a stranger in your own land. You do
not recognize yourself in how others see you. It is a struggle to feel seen and
honored . . .[Y]ou are slipping backward.
</blockquote>
It is this is feeling that found a voice in Trump in whom belated identification
has become hope, in whom anger has been given an authorized outlet. What's a
possible solution? I'm not qualified to offer one.

But strangers—Shipler also wrote a book about them, though through a racial
lens: A COUNTRY OF STRANGERS: BLACKS AND WHITES IN AMERICA. It was published
when I was 4, and I can still remember clearly the night of December 3, 1997
when my celestial glory, newspaper and coffee in hand, sat down in front of the
TV, eagerly waiting for him to appear on C-SPAN. Clinton, then president, was
holding a town hall to discuss race, and a recording is now available online.
The snippet I'm talking about is between 28:09 and 44:13, and this
<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?96122-1/town-meeting-race&start=1689">link</a>
defaults to its start. Shipler said:
<blockquote>
I feel that we're in a different phase of race relations in this country than we
used to be, and in some ways it's a more complicated phase. Bigotry, for the
most part, is not as blatant and obvious and outrageous as it used to be. A lot
of it has gone underground. It takes subtler forms, encrypted forms. Prejudice
is a shapeshifter. It's very agile in taking forms that seem acceptable on the
surface . . . I think for us as white Americans to understand some of this, we
have to reflect on some of the differences in experiences we've had as opposed
to those that Blacks and other minorities have had . . . I think in a dialogue
of this kind, the key is to listen, not just to talk . . . I'm hoping that if
we listen to each other, we can begin to diminish the size of that chasm and
perhaps even make this society of ours into less and less of a country of
strangers.
</blockquote>
Clinton added, "I don't think there is any legal policy answer to this. I think
this is something we've really got to work our way through." Beverly Daniel
Tatum was present too and said, "There's a lot of silence about these issues,
and I think breaking this silence is something many people are afraid of doing.
And as you pointed out we can't really fix this problem or continue the
improvement until we're able to engage in honest dialogue about that." On the
opposing side, Abigail Thernstrom, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a
conservative think tank, spoke about how far we've come since the 1960s and how
integrated the country had become. I think she meant well, but I think when you
pick certain data points, you can paint a better picture than how things are,
and relying on surveys for issues like race reveals less about outcomes and
behaviors than the prevailing fashionable attitudes of the time. When it's hot
out, it won't help to check the weather channel if your house is burning. Show

doctors, like the entire sample, showed an implicit preference for [w]hite
Americans relative to Black Americans. We examined these effects among [w]hite,
African American, Hispanic, and Asian MDs and by physician gender. Strength of
implicit bias exceeded self-report among all test takers except African
American MDs.
</blockquote>
I can agree that by 1997 there had been progress compared to the 1960s,
according to the data that Thernstrom mentioned, but the message she's
conveying is that much progress had already been made, which begs the
question, "Why are people still worked up about this?", which leads to a
dangerous complacence. But an important thing to recognize is how in 1997 we
can sit down and talk about these things, disagreement or not. Two decades
later, how far have we come as a country? Anne Applebaum
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/milley-critical-race-theory-marxism-racism-fox-news/619308/">wrote</a>
in The Atlantic the importance of openness to ideas, starting with a class I was
vividly alive to be physically in:
<blockquote>
Back in the 1980s, comparative-literature majors at my university had to take a
required course in literary theory. This course—Lit 130, if memory
serves—offered prospective scholars a series of frames and theories that could
be applied to the reading of books . . . We suffered through a lot of turgid
academic writing, but the class had its uses. I learned, among other things,
that one can read the same text from multiple points of view and therefore see
different themes in it. When a Marxist reads Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice,
for example, he might become interested in the way in which wealth, power, and
the determination to have both shapes the lives of all of the characters. When
a feminist reads the same book, she might discover that patriarchal attitudes
toward women, who are judged and valued for their marriageability, shape the
lives of the characters too. The Freudians, as you might surmise, would notice
a whole different set of motifs . . . In his congressional testimony last week,
General Mark Milley endorsed the underlying philosophy of Lit 130, which also
happens to be the underlying philosophy of a liberal education: Read widely;
listen to everybody; make your own judgment about what's important. Here is how
he put it: 'I do think it's important actually for those of us in uniform to be
open-minded and be widely read.' The phrase widely read means that you can and
should read things you disagree with. You can definitely read Marx without
becoming a Marxist. You can read critical race theory without becoming
a 'critical race theorist,' however you define that . . . You can also read
American history in this same spirit, the way you would read a great piece of
literature, seeking to understand the complexities and the nuances, the dark
and the light, the good and the bad. You can be inspired by the Declaration of
Independence, horrified by the expulsions of Native Americans, amazed by the
energy of immigrants and frontier settlers. You can understand that the United
States is a great and unique country whose values are worth defending—and
realize simultaneously that this same country has made terrible mistakes and
carried out horrific crimes. Is it so difficult to hold all of these disparate
ideas in your head at the same time?
</blockquote>
Applebaum then critiques those on both extremes, the rabid critical race
theorists who can't tolerate dissidents and the far right that refuses to deign
even a nod to critical race theory:
<blockquote>
Soldiers should know, Milley declared, that African Americans were counted as
less than fully human until 'we had a civil war and Emancipation Proclamation
to change it.' It took 'another 100 years,' he noted, to get to the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. All of that should sound completely uncontroversial. It's
just a recitation of facts about American history, things that most people
learn in elementary school. But to Fox News's Tucker Carlson, the mere
suggestion that you should seek to understand your own society, including its
flaws, makes you a 'pig' and 'stupid.' Laura Ingraham, another Fox News host,
called for defunding the military in response to Milley's statements, on the
grounds that 'he's chosen to indulge the radical whims of Democrats.' The
Carlsons, Ingrahams, and other culture warriors who now dominate the world of
conservative infotainment seem now to believe that the study of American
history—the knowledge of what actually happened on the territory that lies
between the two shining seas—should be forbidden. The Republican-controlled
state legislatures and school boards that are currently seeking to ban the
teaching of 'critical race theory' have this same intention . . . But there is
another kind of person who might dislike Milley's attitude. Critical race
theory is not the same thing as Marxism, but some of its more facile
popularizers share with Marxists the deep conviction that their way of seeing
the world is the only way worth seeing the world. Moreover, some have
encouraged people to behave as if this were the only way of seeing the world.
The structural racism that they have identified is real, just as the class
divisions once identified by the Marxists were real. But racism is not
everywhere, in every institution, or in every person's heart at all times. More
to the point, any analysis of American history or American society that sees
only structural racism will misunderstand the country, and badly. It will not
be able to explain why the U.S. did in fact have an Emancipation Proclamation,
a Civil Rights Act, a Black president. This is a major stumbling block, not so
much for the legal scholars (some of whom actually merit the title 'critical
race theorist') but rather for the popularizers and the
scholars-turned-activists who want to force everybody to recite the same
mantras.
</blockquote>
Listen to both sides! What a great idea that seems to come from common sense!

And what is the racialized experience like? Step back to 1992, when I, then -1
years old, frolicking in the ether and couldn't wait to materialize, about
thirty years before George Floyd's murder drew national attention, Jane
Elliott
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebPoSMULI5U">ran</a>
her brown eye/blue eye experiment, which reverses the direction of
discrimination, on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The video is half an hour long. If
you are white and are too uncomfortable to watch it to the end, how do you
suppose you can understand the many for whom this experience is America's
reality that the country has decided not to see? For people of color, they
would find in Jane the voice of grievance that working class whites have found
in Trump. Indeed, the experience of watching this video breaks through the
simple, naive, token emotions of one-dimensional happiness and joy of popular,
commercialized entertainment and touches briefly something of the heights of
literature, which is that humor and rage, truth and tragedy, mania and sanity,
life and its passing, are all one and the same.

When working class whites have been positioned at the front line to combat
others who have been historically oppressed, when neither group owns any
significant share of the country's wealth, is it not then obvious who is
fanning the flames? I don't think some mastermind is orchestrating some
conspiracy, but that those who live in everyday insecurity, when aggravated,
fall into a competition to get ahead of each other, and those who are more
privileged stand guard over their own possessions as they watch the chaos
unfold, laying out a narrative that even touching a fraction of the millions or
billions in their portfolios which they do not use stifles progress and
innovation or pushes the country towards socialism, when they clutch their
purses and think, "What business is it of mine to step in?"

Even with Trump out of office,
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/29/a-partisan-chasm-in-views-of-trumps-legacy/ft_21-03-24_trump_legacy_feelings_new1/">views</a>
on him have largely remained unchanged among Democrats and Republicans, and what
we will have in coming elections is more of the same contention, polarization,
and distrust across parties because the underlying issues of inequality remain,
susceptible to dirty marketing tactics by unscrupulous politicans more
interested in their lining their pockets than running a government. The trend,
however, is that younger generations are more liberal according to
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/030118_o_5/">this</a>
and

to changing traditions, and the Congress that entered office this year is
already more
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/10/the-changing-face-of-congress/">diverse</a>
in race, gender, and religion.
A
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/coming-generation-war/588670/">projection</a>
indicates that by 2039, Gen Z and Millenials will consist of nearly 70%
self-identifying Democrats. Given these trends, it may not be too off the mark
to claim: if the country manages to not descend into civil war, then politics
in the next decades, whoever the next Trumpist demagogue is in 2024 and
thereafter, will resemble the stock market, waves of short-term volatility as
distractions to the inevitable trajectory towards progress when the younger
generations, more open, more tolerant, more willing to fix problems and move
forward, constitute growing shares of the electorate.

Yet progress of this kind poses another problem to a healthy democracy when it
turns into a one-party monopoly. The victory at the top also comes with the
isolation of not having a sparring partner of equal standing. What will become
of the Republican Party? How will conservative populism evolve to confront the
problems of modernity when it can no longer appeal to a declining constituency
invigorated by toxic bravado, narrow-minded calls to a past era that is not
returning, smokescreening actual issues by yelling, "Look at those evil people
changing things!", instead of constructive solutions. How will the new platform
of the Republican party mitigate the dawn of a glamorous new serfdom at Apple
Park, Zuckerberg Park, and Bezos Park with equitable job growth, balance the
tax rate of less than
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">4%</a>
among the 25 richest Americans and a certain
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html">politician</a>
who has a history of avoiding taxes with HILLBILLY ELEGY, THE WORKING POOR, and
HARVEST OF SHAME, while also addressing climate change instead of thinking it a
hoax? How much is ExxonMobil paying you?

And what will happen to the Democratic Party once its principal opponent fades
into something of the past? Will its coalition that put itself together, each
group advancing its own interests by absorbing its neighbors', held into one by
intolerable, toxic fumes coming out of the other side's pulpit, break into
foolish fragments as predictable as human nature, white women prioritizing
white women, Blacks voting for Blacks, Asians for Asians, Hispanics for
Hispanics, and white men, caught between race and gender, choose race and side
with white women? The results from last week's NYC Democratic mayoral primary
suggest just this kind of racial delineation. Putting the candidates' proposed
policies aside, a neighborhood's voter preference strongly resembles its racial
composition. The Times released an interactive district-level
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/23/nyregion/nyc-mayor-primary-results-precinct-map.html">map</a>
of how the city voted, which can be compared with a map of the city's racial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_York_City&oldid=1030916027#/media/File:Race_and_ethnicity_2010-_New_York_City_(5559914315).png">distribution</a>
Manhattan's core, predominantly white, voted for Kathryn Garcia. The Asian
neighborhoods, and oddly also the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Borough Park,
voted for Andrew Yang. And Harlem, the Bronx, and large swaths of Queens and
Brooklyn, in the Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, voted for Eric Adams or Maya
Wiley. I don't think these results are a coincidence, and if this is a
precursor to what will happen to the Democratic Party, then perhaps all one can
do is shrug in disappointment. If you say race is not a problem and you are
white, let me know again when I point out that the
<a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/children-are-at-the-forefront-of-u-s-racial-and-ethnic-change/">minorities</a>
of today will soon no longer be minorities and that Christianity, even
considered as the sum of its denominations, may very well not be the
predominant
<a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/">religion</a>
for much longer. This is the inconvenient problem of race, not as discriminatory
racism which also needs to be addressed, but as the country's identity shift.
Perhaps fortunately, this is a problem of time, and the free solution is the
passing of the decades, when the younger generations have already been slowly
acclimating to the changing face of America which in a gradual shift will not
seem out of the ordinary, like eyes seeing their reflection every morning but
don't notice the wrinkles accumulating on the face. If you say race is not a
problem and you are not white, consider what will happen when white Hispanics
start voting like whites, Blacks push for expanding affirmative action, Asians
insist on maintaining policing. What will become of race then? Time will tell,
but perhaps it'll only be a problem when people remain walled up in
self-interested isolation, but why not be spurred by the idea of trying
something new? Why not? How many in the American heartland still conceive of
New York as just the one in the past as sung by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrUfJW1JGk">Sinatra</a>
without also realizing there's also the modern ones by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsZlY0Vz4-o">Jay-Z</a>
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHKXYWZYH5E">Alicia Keys</a>?

Back to the present. I'll end this section on politics with
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/">comments</a>
of how each party feels about the other. It reads like a dysfunctional
relationship. Their words, not mine, but the Republican views I disagree with
are the ones that have no easy compromise and ones I don't think are promising
to address because they existed even before the current hysterical
polarization, distrust, cancel culture, and utter lack of communication between
parties, and which are not the cause of the country's intolerance towards the
other side but which only seem exacerbated because of growing economic
imbalance, when one side is naively scapegoating in a rapidly changing
demographic and the other stings with unaddressed racial and gender
inequalities. These issues are: abortion, gun rights, implementing religion
values in the law, and whether the Constitution should be adapted to the modern
country and not remain catered to the one two hundred years ago. I'll also take
the liberty to add that two hundred years ago was when people weren't able to
buy assault rifles, when slavery was legal and the original text
proclaimed, "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
several States which may be included within this Union, according to their
respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of
free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and
excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons"—until one
century later when an amendment repealed such nonsense.

<b id="2021-04-04">2021-04-04, 日. On Religion and Roger Scruton.</b>

I'm an atheist, and today's post situates my views in the context of religion,
and why the religion question largely doesn't matter.

First, I will state some of my doubts. To even begin to convince me to believe
in God, you must answer this question of mine: why Jesus or Yahweh or Allah when
I can also choose Zeus and Hera, Shiva and Brahma, Isis and Osiris, Odin and
Ymir, Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl, Ababinili and Agu'gux, Hadad and Anu?
Why one god and not four hundred? Would God have been the next titular character
had Joseph Campbell extended his HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES? I can't shake off
the observation that those who are religious are religious because of a sense of
community and not because they are wholly convinced from first principles in the
existence of God. To convince me to be religious is to show me that faith is not
just the happenstance religion of the society into which we are born, assigned
at birth and immured as the sole option when we are too young to resist our
parents and our friends, too young to think and doubt, too young to realize that
by adulthood we will be too accustomed to holding on to faith out of nominal
identification with that community and not out of true belief.

I'm not speaking of religion in the way Alan Watts did when he used a marketing
ploy to slip God under the cover of mesmerizing rhetoric. The God he spoke of
was not the omnipotent deity of the Judeo-Christian tradition but a god
embedded in the personal and everyday, everywhere and needing no more worship
than a spiritual awareness. What a great cheat! How he committed the
intellectual laziness of conflating one god with another by using the same
terminology! The notion of God is too loosely defined. Do we agree with
Maimonides when he explained that the Jewish God is such a perfect unity that
he could not be described in any positive sense, and we cannot say God has arms
or legs, or that God is omnipotent, or that God has thoughts, for any such
statement limits the greatness of God? Surely one can follow this description
as one can follow a thought experiment, but no one can persuade me away from my
immediate thought: what a wonderful fiction!—though such a character is
certainly too dull for my book.

To live motivated by the thought that disorderly conduct towards your fellow men
earns you a one-way ticket to eternal condemnation seems to me immensely
self-centered because such a guiding principle suggests we have an eye towards
our own fates when we choose how to behave  towards others, and that propriety
is not a self-evident principle derivable from common sense and reason. How low
does this suggest of us and our fellow men that we can't be decent without fear
of punishment? Bertrand Russell wrote, "Religion, since it has its source in
terror, has dignified certain kinds of fear, and made people think them not
disgraceful. In this it has done mankind a great disservice: all fear is bad. I
believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive. I am
not young, and I love life. But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the
thought of annihilation. Happiness is none the less [sic] true happiness
because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value
because they are not everlasting. Many a man has borne himself proudly on the
scaffold; surely the same pride should teach us to think truly about a man's
place in the world. Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver
after the cosy indoor warmth of traditional humanising myths, in the end the
fresh air brings out vigour, and the great spaces have a splendour of their
own." One can enter the sublime by sitting in church in the front pew, enjoying
Bach's music playing under the towering apse just as one can enter it by lying
back on the open grass, under the constellations of the night sky, all on one's
own, contemplating  the stars whence one came; one can be spiritual without a
god. Humanity's pursuits—reaching for transcendence, enjoying music, living
virtuously, seeking meaning and purpose—what does God have to do with them?
Everything we've done, we've done without Him.

The most compelling argument for believing in God I've come across is Roger
Scruton's. Scruton did not dodge the hard questions, did not consider his views
an obvious truth, was not intolerant to conflicting views, and was not so
deluded in his own beliefs that he couldn't accommodate cross-examination.
During an interview he was asked, "God. We got rid of Him, finally. We finally
recognized we are totally alone in the universe. Oceans of time before us,
oceans of time after us—Schopenhauer—yeah? And amidst we are, giving meaning to
our lives, just one little second in eternity. And now you're coming up with God
again. In three or four minutes you're talking about a <i>moral</i> God." The
interviewer continued: "If we see our presence in the universe at this very
moment in time for 60 or 70 or 80 years as one whisper, and we can't give
meaning to our own lives because there are no preconditions, there is no God,
there is no moral statement in the universe itself, of the universe itself.
Isn't that more challenging than returning to the old idea of a moral God?"
Taken aback for a second from so direct a question, Scruton replied: "If you
want to live your life being challenged, that's fine. There are lots of things
more challenging than my worldview, but it doesn't follow they're for that
reason more true. It's possible for someone like Rilke to live with a kind of
death of God feeling, to say to himself, 'For God has been taken from the world,
along with so much else. I will now remake everything according to my own inner
light and find consolation there.' And to some extent, that's what I do, but not
everybody is Rilke. Most people, deprived of this kind of consolation, don't
rise to the challenge at all. They sink a long way beneath it, and they live
without that aspiration to be something better that they would otherwise have
had. And so I'm very much opposed to taking this sort of thing away from people.
If you lose it yourself, then of course that could be regarded as a misfortune,
or you might regard it a great liberation, as Nietzsche tried to do. But that's
your problem. You deal with it. I have my own way of dealing with it, and I
think I have dealt with it. I worked my way back to something, not really the
God of organized religion, but I worked my way back to something like a God
idea. I'm giving it a place in my life which enables me to stand to some extent
in judgment of myself, as I think I should." Fair enough. This answer satisfies
me, and I can respect Scruton for it. The necessary consequence, of course, is
that Scruton thinks we were both created in the image of God and that I have
fallen from favor, while I think his belief in an unprovable deity ludicrous. No
further word can be said that can change our minds, but this doesn't matter
because the thwarted conversation is postponed until the infinitude that comes
after the day when both of us are dead, when, as far as we're concerned,
everything ceases to matter. I may not agree with Scruton's views, but I can
respect him for adequately examining his convictions and living by them to the
very end.

I am not Richard Dawkins. I don't impose atheism on anyone. Freedom of religion
is one of the founding principles of the country. If you are religious, be
satisfied in your community, and I mine, which proclaims: We have no god to
love, and no god loves us, we do not believe in deities whose business it is to
lord over our miniscule lives, for we believe not in gods but in humanity. I
can find the religiously devout among those I consider at the pinnacle of
humanity: Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, William Blake, just as I can
find among them atheists. My gripe is not against religion itself but the lack
of the necessary search and labor to convince oneself beyond, "It's what
everyone around me believes, and we fear those who don't."

In America, we have a party that knows it is losing power and instead of a
graceful handover and adapting to the times, it resorts to pathetic measures
like gerrymandering and restricting the voting rights of Americans who are not
on their side, the whole party patently struggling to hold on to dear life. I
can respect Scruton, but I can't respect the whole line of Republican senators
who ride on disinformation, sending the wrong message to working class Americans
to vote against their interests so the rich can have lower taxes, those
Republicans who sell religious and national purity like Mitch McConnell—whose
wife happens to be Chinese and who is responsible for his wealth—and Ted Cruz,
and their predecessor William Buckley who would have rather resorted to lies
and elitism rather than accept progress. Why all the opposition to change?
Martin Luther posting his NINETY-FIVE THESES on a church's door sounds pretty
radical. A group of 102 religious pilgrims seeking religious freedom sailing on
the Mayflower to a new, largely unknown continent sounds pretty radical. The
French Revolution sounds pretty radical. This is the pattern of human
civilization: today's radical is tomorrow's past, as certain and unyieldable as
the iron law of history. As Schopenhauer put it, "All truth passes through three
stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is
accepted as being self-evident." For the logical among us, think of it this way:
jump forward on the timeline and look back; today's radicalism is already in the
past. This is not to say all change is progress. Marxism, Nazism, Communism,
Fascism, anarchy, populism, nuclear fallout, and nativism are not avenues of
progress. Progress is determined by what works as a push forward for humanity,
not by self-interest, power-mongering, greed, and blinkered nationalism.

The remainder of this post discusses Scruton. In considering my differences
against Scruton, I can't help but also notice the immense similarities, and I
recall Schopenhauer's  world as illusion, world as appearance, reality as but a
surface veneer. Schopenhauer took this idea from the ancient Vedic tradition,
which also had so inspired Hesse that one of his recurring projects was an
attempt to reconcile the West's dilemma between rationality and the animal
within against India's amorphous nature of reality. Peel away our differences—he
a conservative and I a liberal, his Christianity and my atheism, his British
reserve, stiff upper lip, preoccupation with dignity,  ever aspiring to serenity
and order, and my fearless charge towards intensity, passion, flame, grabbing
life by the horns, he who returns ever again to equilibrium when I say, "Why
bother resting? After this brief stint, we have all eternity for
equilibrium"—and there is more  in Scruton that I can respect not only because
of his unmitigated journey towards authenticity, but because the underlying
ideas guiding the way he lived his life are also mine.

Scruton defended Heidegger's notion of dwelling as "this attempt to reaffirm
with your connection with a particular place at a particular time and a
particular social web . . . Every serious idea is dangerous. In a civilized mind
it is not. It is an instrument of peace. I'm talking about peaceful existence in
a single place, an unthreatening form of being"—Scruton not only agrees with
this as an intellectual idea but lived by it. Scruton expands on this idea with
Hegel's homecoming spirit: "In all of us there is a desire for homecoming, where
we find ourselves having ventured out into all these dangerous experiments of
individual living, at last coming back, swallowing all our pride, and humbly
acquiescing in a social order which is bigger than ourselves." In these words
Scruton also captured the trajectory of his life, as he recounted his early
years: "I was very fortunate in having an unhappy childhood so that my desire
from the very beginning was to escape from it . . . I was very much aware of the
difference between me and everybody else, that there was something in me that
needed to be addressed. I had a question in my life. I didn't know what the
question was, but I knew that it needed an answer, and I had first to identify
what the question was. So the things that my contemporaries took pleasure in,
like football, cinema, whatever it might be, pop music, had very little
significance for me, even though like all my contemporaries of course I played
the guitar, a bit of bass guitar, and all the usual—things one had to do. But
even while doing it I regarded myself just as ridiculous as the people around
me." It was only later that Scruton gradually came upon how to pose the
question: "Someone like Heidegger would say it was the question of Being. What
and why am I? What is this soul doing in this environment, and how can  it
possibly come to be in that environment in a way that will bring peace to
itself?" In middle age, Scruton described his fear of choosing to abandon his
position as a professor as "being afraid to give up a career that I thought to
be certain and secure, but I knew that I should give it up because it was not
me, my career as a teacher. I finally got the courage to give it up, but I left
it very late." And in describing the broader fear of living, Scruton said, "When
you're confronted with this sort of fear, you might run from it into false
consolations, things which are not real consolations because they involve no
overcoming . . . I can see what it would be to take refuge in wine completely,
and allow that to soothe one through one's day and to soothe one through one's
inadequacies, to enable one to put this fear to one side.  That is not a
consolation. A consolation to me comes from having confronted trouble, and
eliciting from the heart of the trouble the resolution of it." Scruton examines
himself in the way of someone who has the habit of doing deep reflection: "I
have always worked very hard at my literary gifts, but in every direction
they've suggested, philosophical essays, fiction, anything that seems to come to
my pen, but it's always been enormous work, and I've always connected it
deliberately with my subjectivity, the peculiar confusion which I inherited by
being born the thing that I was. And I made them slaves, my literary works, of
my need, and each of them had the task of unraveling this confusion . . . except
for a few academic articles, all this has been a completely personal voyage of
discovery . . . so this was a very personal thing, which had nothing to do with
the normal <i>Bildung</i> of a normal academic philosopher. My life was a kind
of <i>Bildungsroman</i> in which the academic part was a sort of continuous and
enjoyable mistake. I shouldn't have been a teacher, or I shouldn't have been
locked away in libraries. My heart and soul have always been in other things,
I've always been involved in other things, which have always been more important
to feeding what I really think."

Scruton's first marriage failed, but his second marriage, at 52, to Sophie
Jeffreys, after a "slow, quiet, respectful courtship," not in the searing
passion of uninhibited romance but in the quaint charm, quiet serenity,
coquettish allure, and mutual attraction hidden beneath preserved dignity so apt
to the British manner, lasted until his death. Scruton composed a piece for the
piano dedicated to his wife "which would convey something of her composure and
orderliness." He called it BOREAS BLOWS NOT, referencing Herodotus: "Boreas
blows not through the young virgin who lives alone in the house with her mother.
Because at the time, Sophie was living alone in her house with her mother. So it
was a description of Boreas the north wind refusing to blow, or unable to blow,
through this secure little cottage." Scruton made for himself and his wife a
version of this little cottage, with a yard in the front for the horses he kept
for fox-hunting. In his cottage in the countryside of Wiltshire, on a plot of
land he bought that he named Scrutopia, Scruton lived out his years with his
wife among books lining the walls and a grand piano in the center of the living
room. True to his word, Scruton dwelled, playing Bach in his village's church
every Sunday. Scruton dwelled, returning to the countryside into which he was
born: "My childhood was in a semi-detached house by a railway line in which we
were, you know, very poor, very much living in the old class resentment of the
English . . . It has nothing to do with this. This here is created by books and
music in the middle of a countryside which I love and among people doing
innocent old-fashioned things with animals. That's as far as one can get." In
Wiltshire, Scruton lived until his death in January 2020. May he rest in the
peace of eternity that I too will one day join, hopefully having attained the
same peace in human terms.

<b id="2021-02-11">2021-02-11, 四. On Race, Diversity, and Immigration.</b>

Today's post is delicate for obvious reasons. Reader be warned, this may make
you more uncomfortable than my other posts, but this is an important issue to
explore.<br>
___

Let's cast aside the political polarization for a moment and have a mature
conversation on race and the future identity of America. It's not popular these
days but I don't think it's inherently racist to talk about race and its
practical consequences, from both perspectives: the white's and the person of
color's. There are very real issues that have to be addressed. The recent rise
of neo-Nazies, conspiracy theories, and white supremacism is not possible under
a well-functioning democracy. It only happens when people are insecure and under
threat, and this threat stems from 1) poor white folks who feel the country has
forgotten them and 2) the rapid demographic changes are altering the country's
identity. I have nothing insightful to say about the first reason on top of the
obvious need to address the problem. This post addresses the second reason.

<b>Discontent</b>

Here are the facts.
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/03/14/the-us-will-become-minority-white-in-2045-census-projects/">Estimates</a>
project that the country will become majority non-white in 2045. It's very soon—
I'll likely still be alive when it happens. What do whites, who are losing
representation, think of this? A
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/03/21/views-of-demographic-changes-in-america/">survey</a>
found nearly as many view it positively (26%) as negatively (28%).

I'd like to first write a bit with the 28% in mind. At the extreme is the
far-right. Richard Spencer, Lauren Southern, and Gavin McInnes are saying, "We
built the wealthiest nation on Earth, we introduced democracy and defended it,
we created a free state for all, we created the modern world, and who are these
foreigners coming over and stealing our inheritance from us?" This is indeed the
reality, and I have to say, they have a point. There's a conversation to be had,
certainly not one I can settle but let's examine this further. My view in the
end is that resources, opportunities, and equitable values should not be hoarded
within lines as arbitrary as race.

It's worth repeating: I don't think it's racist to talk about whites wishing to
preserve Western civilization. It's a matter of defensive self-conservation. The
far right is the loudest but in today's intolerance that's the only venue to
voice this defensive stance. Again I don't think this is racist but their
concern is they're being pushed out. I read this from somewhere online—to my
fellow liberals, this might be useful to see where the right is coming
from—consider a white person moving to China and demanding that Chinese culture
be moved aside, that the Chinese should lose rights for racial equality, and
that the Chinese should be disarmed and have no option to push back. It's not
racist but such actions provoke self-defense even by a neutral bystander. The
question is whether it's fair to believe the dominant culture of the country
(white culture) would be happy becoming just another minority group and losing
the power it's had since the country's inception. I'd like to believe so because
the way forward for the country is to accommodate all Americans but I suspect
many white folks, openly or privately, don't—specifically the 28% in the survey
who didn't even bother pretending. The question isn't about equality. The
country's changing racial demographics is like saying: imagine a Britain that's
not predominantly British or a China that's not predominantly Chinese. And no
matter our skin color, if any of us takes a stroll along the Seine in Paris and
see more Muslims in hijabs than the original French, does Paris feel French?
This is the unsettling reality. Suppose for a moment that we lifted every poor
white American out of poverty and secured their future prospects. Even then,
would they be happy with no longer being able to identify with what the country
is becoming? Conservatives feel their homeland is being hijacked even while we
progressives see inequality at every turn. It's a problem in Europe too with the
Syrian refugee crisis. Whiteness, Christianity, and the European identity that
built the country are being threatened and what we're doing is blanket-blocking
any mention of it as racist when there's a valid point here.

This problem extends to academia. A very recent vanguard in the humanities has
essentially been saying: "we" have been oppressed, colonialized,
underrepresented, and now that we're empowered we're going to take what's ours
and air our dirty laundry. I'm not saying their push for equality is wrong but
that they leave no room for the other side in a climate of cancel culture. Think
of all the academics whose entire careers are based on what is now blatantly
called imperialist and colonialist. The premise of the country as a free state
where all are equal is not possible when we are separating ourselves into
piecemeal subcultures defending our turf. America cannot be an either/or but has
to be an inclusive both/and. Among many other adjustments, the required
coursework reading may very well have to change from the exclusively white
Western canon and the field may need some serious reflection on its context and
history, but this doesn't mean dissolving the discipline, as Dan-el Padilla
Peralta is open to doing with the classics. Let's recall that even ideas as
radically departing from traditional Western perspective as those in Edward
Said's ORIENTALISM didn't call for destroying the whole field.

What is happening is human nature: everyone pursues his interest, and it is the
country that plays mediator for all citizens. Can we each stop demonizing the
other side? It is useful to keep in mind John Rawls' veil of ignorance and take
a step back from our particular place in society to think larger. With America
soon to become majority non-white, we have to make peace with that fact. Now,
onto something more interesting.

<b>Towards a Brighter Future</b>

This is sobering: a
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376654">study</a>
last year found that when people are forming teams and adding members, they
deliberately reduce diversity when they are shown whether a potential member
boosts or drops the team's overall diversity. This behavior looms large.
For all we tout diversity in our public relations messaging, for all the
apparent diversity in cities, residential neighborhoods are largely segregated
by race, even in our most diverse cities:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127082921/www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-Urban-Research/CUR-research-initiatives/The-End-of-Segregation-Hardly">New York City</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210915084136/belonging.berkeley.edu/racial-segregation-san-francisco-bay-area-part-1">San Francisco</a>,
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210115210129/today.uic.edu/new-report-details-chicagos-racial-ethnic-disparities/">Chicago</a>.
And this
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211229001323/http://racialdotmap.demographics.coopercenter.org/">map</a>
shows the race distribution in the country using the 2010 census data, with one
dot per person, each dot colored by race. This is the undeniable state of
affairs: de facto segregation. Residential segregation translates to school
segregation.
<a href="https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/30098/why-have-americas-public-schools-gotten-more-racially-segregated">These</a>
maps show segregation consistent with the country's racialized geography, and
this is over half a century after <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.
Whatever image of a racially integrated country we may have in mind is not just
overly optimistic but entirely wrong. PRRI
<a href="https://www.prri.org/research/poll-race-religion-politics-americans-social-networks/">surveyed</a>
racial compositions in 2013 of social networks within racial groups and
revealed shocking homogenity. Among whites, 91% of friends are also white,
among Blacks, 83% are Black, and among Hispanics, 64% are Hispanic. And Asians?
No data for us. We're invisible. But these numbers remind me of Beverly
Daniel Tatum's WHY ARE ALL THE BLACK KIDS SITTING TOGETHER? because of its
title and how it cuts at the core of the matter. What is disheartening is I have
not even the slightest instinct to say these numbers are out of touch with
reality. What about the entertainment we consume? A
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/61/2/369/4098571">study</a>
found "[w]hite participants showed significantly less interest in seeing movies
with mostly Black casts than in seeing movies with mostly [w]hite casts."
Another
<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1996-05-02-1996123149-story.html">study</a>
found that whites and Blacks have few favorite TV shows in common.
And books? I couldn't find a study on this, but let's be honest. If we can't
even bring ourselves to watch movies and TV across race, how many do we suppose
have read James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, or Toni Morrison? Or Zadie Smith, Salman
Rushdie, Orhan Pamuk?

So we don't live together, don't go to the same schools, aren't friends with
each other, don't watch the same movies or TV shows, and if we meet each other
at work what guides our conversations is a societal restraint from broaching
race that precludes any serious discussion and mingling. How then are we to make
friends across racial lines if we don't have much in common, can't point out the
obvious, and skirt about the issue by talking shop, and when we invite that
friend to our circle of largely homogenous friends we are also transferring the
burden of restraint to them? And what are we talking about when we say with such
conviction that we understand the Black plight or that of other minorities who
have been less abused and less disenfranchised over the course of the country's
history if the immensity of our unquestioned confidence comes from—indeed
betrays—our own realities, our projected mythologies and imaginations exchanged
among friends, cloistered in our communities where everyone looks and thinks
like ourselves?

Racial inequality is something we can't help but pick up on. We adults don't
talk about it because we've learned restraint, afraid of saying the wrong thing,
and instead keep quiet or look away. Kids notice it too but are more open to
speaking their minds. In the podcast NICE WHITE PARENTS, the host Chana
Joffe-Walt describes this kind of situation when white students, who bring more
funding power, started enrolling at a predominantly Black and Hispanic middle
school: "These boys, even at 11 years old, they've absorbed the same messages
that [the school] wasn't so good before. It was a bad school. He and his
friends, they've turned the school around. That's what he's learning." This is
what the boy in question said: "The kids wouldn't pay attention. And they had,
like--got to, like, zone out every little thing. And I bet they learned very
little. And now this generation with us, I think we're doing a lot better. And I
think that we're learning at a much faster pace." This comment isn't racist so
much as it's an innocent observation of a consequence of our education system
and a history of suppression, and what he is saying is something we all notice
when we come across it, but the current political and social climate casts over
us a pall that mutes what we already know as wise silence.

Here I digress to put in a word on immigration. Like any proper New Yorker, I am
a flaming liberal. I support the idea of equal opportunity for all whether in
this country or in any other. In spite of this, I don't think the answer to the
immigration question is to throw open our doors and let everyone in. There is a
limit to how many the country can tolerate without bankrupting the social
system. David Frum
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/">notes</a>
the practical concerns of immigration, that immigrants cost the
government more than they contribute in taxes. A part of me says this is the
price of an egalitarianism, but this deficit also surfaces a brutal reality. How
can we accommodate indefinitely more immigrants when our country is already
steep in debt and millions of our own, those we look in the eye as our fellow
Americans, are struggling? Frum advocates focusing our immigration policy to
accept highly skilled immigrants—doctors and engineers—who earn their keep and
help the country remain innovative. This, of course, means a continual brain
drain from their home countries, which strangely enough has been found to
increase wages and democratic values back home. I'm not convinced, however, that
losing a nation's best and brightest helps a developing country stand on its own
and catch up rather than merely benefiting indirectly from Western progress. But
this is the price of supplying American innovation, securing American
well-being.

Diversity—why is it so difficult? I'm an atheist, yet I've sat with a Protestant
as he prayed for me, I've linked hands with Catholics saying grace before a
meal, I've attended Mass, I've sat in classes full of Catholics. I've joined the
Muslim retreat at the Blue Mosque as the muezzin called and witnessed the hall's
worshipers kneeling on the floor in prayer. I put on a kippah in Jerusalem and
stood face-to-face with the Wailing Wall. I sat among the local community in
Mumbai at a Hindu engagement ceremony. So what that I'm an atheist? We should
keep in mind that what feels foreign to one is home to another, and it was the
arbitrary slight of chance that we ourselves were not born into another's
community.

Diversity is the country's future, and it is a future when the landscape of
writers and directors will have changed, along with the TV-watching and
movie-going market whose preference commands what the entertainment industry
produces. One day, this era's fight for social justice, equal representation,
true equality under law and its enforcement, will have been but one chapter in
the transition to a more equitable world. And one day, we will not think it out
of the ordinary that a lead actor is brown though we notice it and are aware of
the long struggle that made such casting possible, and we will not be
uncomfortable watching a person of color rejoice or sulk or have the full range
of experiences of any ordinary human. One day, the unsightly practice will have
passed when the camera deigns a moment for the diversity shot and then cuts
away, returning to the default whiteness. The country's future is mixed, and we
have to accept this as a reality, not boil over with veiled resentment.

William Buckley wrote, "A conservative is someone who stands athwart history,
yelling Stop." What nonsense. How shortsighted is his view of history that for
him, history extends no further than the past several hundred years since the
Great Divergence that marked the West's emergence as the world's wealthiest and
most advanced civilization, and he happened to have lived in the period when
such self-flattery is possible. The one constant that endures time is change,
and just as no individual lives forever in his youthful peak, no society is
immune to its evolving fortunes. How many came before who met worse fates have
had to accept change? Russians, Indians, Chinese, Persians, Turks, Aztecs,
Egyptians, and all those who belonged to once thriving civilizations: if it is
any consolation, others have been here before, and the decline of white power
in America is one peaceful tick of change in the ocean of our inflated
self-importance. How many in those prior civilizations screamed that the end is
nigh, yet the world has moved on, and they carry about themselves in it as
routinely as the earth revolves around the sun? It's always irked me how any
mentioning the fall of the Roman Empire carries an air of puritanical
nationalism, that it is with resentful resignation that such greatness came to
an end. It certainly was great, but we give the invaders who brought its fall
the exceedingly flattering name of barbarians even though they too had families
and lives, pursuing their interests just as the Romans theirs, and these
barbaric tribes don't seem barbarians any longer when we name them properly:
the Franks settling in modern France, the Visigoths in modern Spain, the
ancestors of the moderns. We sympathize so intensely with the Romans because we
see only one side, and the fact that we continue to use the word barbarians
descends from this lineage—it's what the Romans called outsiders. It is worth
reminding ourselves the truth Carl Sagan pointed out in COSMOS: "National
boundaries are not evident when we view the earth from space. Fanatical ethnic
or religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain when we
see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous
point of light against the bastion and citadel of the stars." That blue
crescent formed 4,500,000,000 years ago, of which we humans developed
agriculture in the last 12,000 and began laying the foundation for
civilization. It is outright foolish to think that human culture has peaked and
should change no further. The future of the country is diversity and what must
happen: acceptance and unity, not separation and exclusion. Why not imagine a
future where we contain Whitman's multitudes? Across canyons and valleys, lush
green praries and eroded rock strewn over sand-blown desert, towering mesas and
redwood forests, we find small towns and major metropolises decorating the land
under the snow-capped mountains, for we are all of us American: brown and
yellow and black and white and blue and red, bound not by prescriptions of the
isolated echo chambers that came before but by a full forward march, hand in
hand, towards a history that will bear our names in pioneering pride. When we
were children we saw ourselves as adventurers and explorers, looking out at a
world full of mystery, curious at everything, unafraid to learn, elated to be
alive. Where has that sense of awe and wonder gone?

<b id="2021-02-09">2021-02-09, 二. In Defense of Abstract Art.</b>

Why view abstract art? When we stand before an abstract painting, what is it
that we're looking at in the indeterminate swirls that don't even remotely
resemble a person, a place, or anything familiar? I wish to address why I prefer
abstraction.

If we can represent nature by reducing it into a set of equations, why not too
visual expression into art's purest form? And what is visual art on the canvas
but the strokes of a brush painting in the four variables of color, shape, size,
and space? Consider Mondrian, Rothko, and Kandinsky. They use these variables to
their own vision, and even with such a small arsenal, how can we say their
compositions are anything but wholly unlike each other? It is often mentioned
that abstract paintings lack technical difficulty. To this I say that the
difficulty of abstraction is in the conception which requires a certain
maturity, not in the elitist sense, but in the capacity to grasp symbolism to
its devastating potential. One way to conceive of the world is to view nature
and the universe as the eternal constants in which we measly humans flicker by,
but another, equally valid one is to place ourselves at the central vantage
point because what will it all have mattered if we don't exist? To appreciate
abstraction is to take the leap from merely mimicking reality, scrupulously
copying down its concretized distinctions and its various shades of light, to
human expression, the crux of what it means to be alive.

I remember the first time I encountered Barnett Newman's VIR HEROICUS SUBLIMIS.
I was pulled to it as if by a magnet, drawn up close to the life-sized red
canvas, the red consuming my entire field of vision, and I felt shivers running
down my spine. Staring straight ahead, I felt transported to another realm, and
what ran through me for a full minute was a whole world of sensory saturation.
The canvas encased all passion, all desire, all rage, all triumph, and it was
surging excitement, jubilation: the sublime. What I felt was nothing less than
the chaos of the universe, human folly, birth and death, our meaningless
motions, coming together in a form so simple. It is an overflowing power even
though the painting does not laboriously enumerate all human mistakes under the
sky, it does not have any semblance of a character or story, it doesn't have any
material substance other than color and size, for this impalpability mirrors
what we have in the end: nothing. And this sensory experience is the meaning of
the work, needing no other indication than the title: Man Heroic Sublime. Some
attempt to approach the painting using traditional methods, examining its
construction and the artist's background. To do so is to have missed the point.
They place undue emphasis on the vertical lines, the zips, and deconstruct the
order in which Newman painted them—it's a rather simple exercise of withholding
some vertical space with tape and then either painting between a pair or
painting around one. But this is not the right way to look at the painting, and
we do not understand the painting through its technicalities any more than we
get closer to understanding what enables life by analyzing the brain's atomic
makeup. The zips merely serve to provide a sense of size for a painting that
stands taller than any viewer.

I am not suggesting that expression and meaning is limited to abstraction's
dominion. Consider Norman Rockwell's undeniably political THE PROBLEM WE ALL
LIVE WITH, or Caspar David Friedrich's proud WANDERER ABOVE THE SEA OF FOG, or
Giorgio de Chirico's dreary THE MELANCHOLY OF DEPARTURE, or the contrast of
human transience and the mountain's unfazed apathy in Hokusai's EJIRI IN THE
SURUGA. Let's not forget Yayoi Kusama's more visceral infinity mirror
installations that manifest her internal world, rife with obsessions, a black
room illuminated by floating lights all around, all receding into the horizon, a
world on fire from which there is no escape, a world into which the public
voluntarily steps. Or the same concept rendered more explicit in Edvard Munch's
THE SCREAM, which unlike the former cannot be misinterpreted as just a pretty
picture. What I am saying is abstraction's poignance arises from its simplicity
that is too often overlooked, a simplicity that not only enhances a painting's
lyric capacity but elevates the art by inflecting upon its very medium so that
the artist, the process, the art meld into one. Why should a Ronnie Landfield
stare at us less directly and speak to us from further away than Vermeer's GIRL
WITH A PEARL EARRING? In one brush stroke dashing across the surface, one color
reaching upwards, dancing among many in our human dynamism, we see not a
landscape or a portrait but a visual ode singing the tune of our inner
complexity.

To stay clear of art's mystique, I must mention the regrettable reality is that
any mention of art is preceded by its reputation. In this sense, art is like
wine tasting. Wine tasting and, even more importantly, the acquired diction
developed to describe it unfortunately connote class aspiration, class
maintenance, and the whole system of media that reinforce wine's continued
esteem and consumption. We don't dwell a second on wine's unfermented cousin,
the unremarkable grape juice, but we go to considerable lengths to distinguish
between wines by variety, region, year, and color. Though we may sensibly
separate a heavy malbec from a mild pinot noir, when we start throwing around
phrases like "flavor of blackberry", "notes of earthy vanilla", "hints of
seasoned red plum", and "a rich dark chocolate lingering in the aftertaste",
all the while affecting a poker face as we swirl and sniff ourselves into high
oblivion, should we not ask ourselves if there might not be a more productive
use of time than making an impression? Any genuine appreciation for wine is
quickly extinguished when artifice enters the conversation. So too is art when
we chase the big name, attach a price tag, and enshroud it in undue mystery.
The art market has not escaped the American variety of ruthless capitalism, and
decades of rising economic inequality has permitted the rise of rogue
billionaires who patronize rogue artists like Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons. Why
do some artists fetch handsome sums at Christie's or Sotheby's while many of
their peers struggle, forced to sell their work on the street? There is a
market whose taste is determined by an exclusive community, and the clients,
keen on entertaining guests of similar standing, viewing a painting as an
investment, patting themselves on the back for procuring a rarefied treasure
for the spouse, transact in prestige which, too, can be bought. The truth is
that the CEOs, the hedge fund managers, and those in the professional class
whose wealth has passed the threshold where capital allocation alone suffices
for comfortable living have not, over the course of their upward career
trajectory, had the time to calibrate artistic taste. The real artist,
dedicated to his craft as a parent to a child, for whom art is a means of
living, is at the mercy of the tastemakers, the curators, the established
critics. Such is the art market. But American capitalism, ever eager to place
its hand on every exchange, bends the market to its own morality. This is not
art for art's sake but raw capitalism. Let us appreciate art on its own accord,
art for all. As Jerry Saltz says, anyone can look at art—including abstract
art.

There is a pond outside, wavelings rippling across the surface, a soft, gentle,
constant wind billowing over its still mass. Two adolescent geese are floating
near the edge, wings folded, necks tall and curved like cranes, feathered
chests thrust out like a hen sitting on her eggs, enticing to the hands like a
pomeranian's coat. It is a cloudy afternoon, a uniform grey pall, bleak and
gloom looming in the skies above, time seemingly halted, the movements of the
guiding lights in abeyance, left without an announcement when late afternoon
becomes early evening. Perhaps it is the changing of the seasons. A mild chill
this morning, headwind of the winter ahead.
