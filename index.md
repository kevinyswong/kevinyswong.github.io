<h2>Ruminations</h2>

<h4>2021-08-19, 四.</h4>
Many years ago, when K was young, lost, and had not yet unravelled himself, he
had a strange, recurring problem of people mistaking his sexual orientation. K
had been accepting of everyone but had never had the slightest doubt in his
mind about something he had always assumed, and the matter would otherwise
never had occurred to him if not for its coming up every now and then with
different people and in different circumstances. One time on campus, in broad
daylight, an Asian chick on the sidewalk walking in the opposite direction
stopped him and said, "Sorry, but have you heard of Stonewall Inn?" Picking up
on what she meant, K chuckled, unsure what about him that day that prompted a
stranger to wonder such a thing and what it was about him that made her
unafraid to march up and ask so openly. Even K with his abnormal standards
would consider it strange to go up to a random guy on the street and ask if
he's gay. K could see that the crass college youngin exerted considerable
restraint to subdue a shameless grin and knew she must be another bloody
liberal like himself. Amused enough, K wanted to get on with his day and
responded plainly, "No, ma'am, I haven't, but perhaps you'd like to show me?"
Another time, on the downtown train from the Upper East Side, a middle-aged man
struck up a conversation with K, and when a few stops later the friendly banter
about the book in K's hand slowly turned into questions that took on a personal
edge, man's intentions dawned on K who then got out a few stops early. Such
advances had happened before, but never in his many dreams had K imagined he
would be the recipient of them from another man. And then K met T. K's
roommate, a psychology major, invited him to a house party at a friend's
apartment in Chelsea. The friend, an economics major, shared a fairly large
apartment with another guy and a girl, both of whom had also invited their
friends. K and his roommate arrived early, and before he knew it K found
himself in the friend's room reading a book which held his attention even after
the party was in full swing, and it wasn't until Psych and Econ came in to tell
him to join the party that K put the book down. These were the days when K had
not yet understood what his blank stares meant as he sat with the group that
was patently enjoying conversation, or why in spite of meaning as well as
anyone to have fun he felt a strange, eerie strain in the air, the neon party
lights dappling the apartment to an unwitting emptiness. Some time into the
party, a few more girls arrived and came over to greet someone in the group. No
more seats available, K unthinkingly invited the one standing in front of him,
the blond one, to sit on his lap. She and K exchanged a few words but otherwise
sat still for several minutes, listening to the group's conversation, the usual
kind of banter at a party that is immediately forgotten afterwards. She was
above average, the kind that wouldn't have too much trouble attracting someone
at the bar and who'd make other guys feel like they'd missed their chance when
you talk to her first but certainly not the kind of unapproachable stunner that
turns heads and sets imaginations on fire. It did not occur to K until later
that he was not aroused, a part of him still excited for the book he put down,
quietly extinguished, present but not being. K was thrown off by books one
night by twelve models dressed for a night out in the Lower East Side when he
was lugging five or six books he'd just bought, waiting to cross the street. K,
at 5'10", is not short, but even from that distance at night he could see that
they were all thin, and all at least as tall as him. As K neared them, one made
a gesture at his direction and said something. The others turned to look,
causing K to be self-conscious, thinking: wrong time, wrong place. K continued
making his way to the subway when two of them took a step back to open the
circle they had formed. Models, entitled enough to think a mere smile can draw
in anyone. K didn't think he was special but with enough anticipation for the
night, a group would welcome anyone who looked adequately interesting. K
thought: a group of two is ideal, three is fine, four is manageable, five is
pushing it, but twelve has squarely entered the realm of intimidation. This
large a group forces the strategy into a terrain he had not yet encountered:
where could even they go for drinks that would seat a walk-in group of
thirteen? As K walked by them, the sound of silence fell on the group, and K
could not strike up the indecency to advise the women what was on his mind:
that if they were out looking to meet guys, that if they were waiting for
someone to spice up their conversation, they should probably not come out by
the dozen because the night out won't be successful unless the stars align and
they come across another, nearly equally large group. But some time before this
night, K was still at the house party when the blond chick was getting ready to
leave. She came up to K, looked him in the eye to say goodbye and mentioned she
was sure they'd see each other again. K, unfazed, did not ask for her number
and said he was sure of it too, hardening his heart with the insight that he
won't be moved by someone who couldn't sway him from a book. K was recounting
his lack of uninterest in the girl when he and a group of friends went for a
bite after the party. K could not have anticipated what T, who everyone knew
was not straight, was thinking when he let out a curious "Hmm". A few weeks
later, T invited his friends to a gathering at a fancy boutique hotel near
Columbus Circle. Apparently his parents cancelled their visit at the last
minute and the room was open for the night. Another party, another few rounds
of drinks with people you don't really know that goes by in another vague
flash. Towards the end T suggested that someone, if tired, could stay the
night. Oh, how naive K was to decide not to haul himself to the subway. After
everyone else left, K took a shower, tucked himself into bed, ready for a night
of rest no different from any other. Then he felt T's hand on his shoulder. The
moment K realized what T had in mind, K knew he should have jumped up, grabbed
his clothes, and stormed out the door, but instead he had had his mind made up
on getting some sleep and was already in bed, and, if he had to admit it, a
part of him was curious what would come of this unusual experience. K, tired,
irritated, impatient, was not in the mood to bicker with a stubborn, panting
horndog hiding behind a thin veneer of tame talk. K found himself caught in an
unreal frustration in which he must, yes, defend that he had a normal appetite
against a college student's zealous thirst which K feared could keep at this
all night, trying to convince him that he doesn't know what he likes. Of all
the things K had seen and knew were pliable, he could not imagine that an
argument could be made about something determined by genes at birth which was,
moreover, something so personal. Though he was under the blanket, K felt
slightly exposed because he was facing the wall while T was facing him. K was
reassured, however, since from what K could tell, T was a bottom. At a certain
point, T switched tactics and decided to soften his voice the way a woman does
when she shows affection to a guy she trusts. K, fearing T was spontaneously
becoming emotionally attached, did not want to picture what was happening back
there and simply thought, "You've got to be kidding me." K, wanting to sleep,
his head dull but forced to remain awake by his neighbor's pestering and
wallowing in inexplicable feelings, K took a step forward and made an offer to
prove once and for all that K did indeed know this about himself and was not
hiding in a closet. It had not fully crossed K's mind what it entailed when he
suggested T confirm the lack of arousal that T would actually reach for K's
area. Though only a brief grope, K was dumbfounded and suddenly fully awake and
asked, "Happy now?" It was only then that K could rest from the unexpected
consequences of an innocent sleepover and emerge, proudly, unscathed the
morning after when T bought K breakfast downstairs, and K gladly accepted it as
a rightful apology. If K knows nothing else, at least he can claim he knows
this part of himself. If this experience was not adequate proof to lay to rest
any vestige of a doubt in himself, he shudders at the thought of what further
proof might look like.

At the library, a mother and her daughter are at a computer carrel. The daughter
is perhaps five years old, seated at the monitor, learning vocabulary, the
words and cartoonized images of "rectangle", "heart", and "horse" appearing as
she clicks to continue. She has on a set of pink Minnie Mouse headphones, one
hand in a fist in front of the keyboard, the other clutching the mouse, her
tiny hand taking up just the top half. She sits idly, completely focused on the
screen, in the original innocence. As I am stepping inside the building,
listening to Tchaikovsky's HYMN OF THE CHERUBIM, I see them and am struck by
the realization that I'm the one at fault. The little girl is wearing a face
mask. Aware of myself, I don't disturb the peace. She and her mother are
minding their business, one family harmlessly going about their day. The
daughter is at the age when the world is still pure, where she views her place
in it as a new addition to the constructive whole. Oh, what the world has in
store for the next generation! The daughter has not yet learned the concept of
money, has not yet joined a political party, has not yet been bombarded by
endless advertisements informing her that she has material needs she does not
know. When I finish my search in the stacks and emerge an hour later, I notice
the mother and daughter have moved to the activity area with other children.
The daughter is sitting on the mother's lap, painting a piece of pottery. The
mother looks on while the daughter slathers on green and blue. While the
daughter continues painting, she momentarily looks up, then returns to her
work. Perhaps that's enough, just enjoying the time. Perhaps it is good that
she does not yet know how a paragon of individualism like Ayn Rand could scoff
at those she named second-handers rather than relating to the collective human
plight, how a major philanthropist like George Soros could be subject to
antiquated racism, how someone as well-meaning as Friedrich Hayek could make it
a brand to defend class and race inequality, how Adolf Loos has reframed
ornament as a crime, how a reader's interpretation of a creative work can be
just as valuable and true as the author's intent, how even time is relative,
how poststructuralism differs from postmodernism, how she should read a certain
kind of book and not others. Children are born good but are gradually corrupted
by exposure to people like me. The daughter is not yet burdened by such
involuted inventions as I-Thou, being-in-itself, being-in-the-world,
thing-in-itself. In her eyes, her mother is her mother, and a pot is just a
pot—she remains free. Perhaps it would have been wiser to simply have been.
What am I, wholly convinced that I wish to bring forth a better future yet in
effect teaching noxious criticism, pervasive self-doubt, contagious gloom? I,
spreading malevolent ideas like the plague, impressing on the mind a scar that
cannot be washed out. Is there a redemption at the end of the tunnel that
justifies the journey?

<h4>2021-08-05, 四.</h4>
The common house spider finds itself a corner to spin a web and waits for its
prey. What does it know of all the other insects in the world, gargantuan and
minuscule, in the deep marshes and desert terrain, that on further shores some
elude webs and can walk on water? We gaze upon the common house spider as the
forest's trees upon us, brittle life that wakes, works, eats, sleeps, a series
of illusions on the tip of the precipice above the eternal void. Omar Khayyam
wrote:

The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br>
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit<br>
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br>
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.

If thoughts are products of chemical and electrical synapses, the body's
chemical inevitability interacting with the external laws of mechanics, is it
possible that the writing of even these words had already been scheduled since
the dawn of time? Is the moving finger itself also a contraption subject to
nature? Some of us meet Halley's Comet twice in our lifetime, once in youth and
again in senility, after the children have moved out, gone to college, and are
in middle age, having started families of their own. Here's a thought: Halley's
Comet knows exactly how our lives will be when we meet again as it glances down
at our earthly, provincial dirt in scorn, as we turn upwards to the night sky
and think, I know what you're made of, when you'll return, and how you're
condemned to rote, routine nothingness: so you, as I. How trifling that the
spider's life-world does not extend beyond its remote corner.

Could it be asked whether creative writing is any different, whether the
spirit within could envelop the stars? E.L. Doctorow wrote, "Writing is like
driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but
you can make the whole trip that way." Eleanor Catton, whose voice has a
writer's introspective gentleness, spoke about writing her novel THE
LUMINARIES:
<blockquote>
One of my earliest ambitions for the novel was that I knew I wanted to write a
book set on the west coast of the South Island during the Gold Rush years, and
I knew I wanted to write it in the Victorian style, as maybe the novels that
had been published at that time might have been in . . . I think that the
process of writing a novel is very, for me at least, very kind of blind. It's a
lot of fumbling in the dark, and as it grows and grows it kind of acquires a
conscience and acquires a kind of shape and a form that maybe you can't quite
see in the abstract before you begin.
</blockquote>

The Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-liang has a trademark slowness that rivals even
Tarkovsky's, but Tarkovsky used slow shots to draw out time, to bring the
viewer face-to-face with it, to elicit the texture of sentience on the
encounter of it with itself, the exhaustion and panting at the end of a
marathon not quickly sated and quenched by the usual remedy of rest and
replenishment but by deliberate protraction to the depths to discover what
there is of consciousness. Tsai Ming-liang used slowness to contrast the
existential alienation of the soul from the meaningless routines of society,
inevitable material decay, and the motions of life—recurring preoccupations
rendered most explicit in his JOURNEY TO THE WEST in which one monk, dressed in
a blood-red robe to contrast with the city streets in the background, walks in
a monument's slow pace for 56 minutes, the pace of a life spent pursuing
meaning juxtaposed with the images of everyday activity—the motions. This film,
I don't think, is one to sit down and watch all the way through once one
understands it, but in a review for a different film of his, a proper one
obeying narrative form, Ebert wrote:
<blockquote>
The reviewers of Tsai Ming-Lian's [sic] 'What Time Is It There?' have compared
it to the work of Yasujiro Ozu, Robert Bresson, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jacques
Tati and Buster Keaton. If none of these names stir admiration and longing in
your soul, start with them, not with Tsai. Begin with Keaton and work your way
backward on the list, opening yourself to the possibilities of silence,
introspection, isolation and loneliness in the movies. You will notice that the
films grow less funny after Keaton and Tati; one of the enigmas about Tsai's
work is that it is always funny and always sad, never just one or the other.
</blockquote>
Tarkovsky mentioned similar ideas when he said:
<blockquote>
Before defining art, or any concept, we must define a far broader question: what
is the meaning of man's life on Earth? Maybe we are here to enhance ourselves
spiritually. If our life tends to this spiritual enrichment, then art is a
means to get there. This, of course, in accordance with my definition of life,
art should help man in this process . . . The problem with young people is
their carrying out noisy and aggressive actions to not feel lonely. And this is
a sad thing. The individual must learn to be on his own as a child, for this
doesn't mean to be alone. It means not to get bored with oneself, which is a
very dangerous symptom, almost a disease . . . Cinema is an unhappy art as it
depends on money, not only because a film is very expensive, but it is then
also marketed like cigarettes . . . The film for the large audience cannot be
poetical. Some films have been seen by millions of people . . . now it's
difficult to surprise the spectator, and good films are not seen by the
masses.

Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME, his most inaccessible film but also his heaviest
one and the one that most openly expresses his vision, as raw and unpolished as
it is beautiful, the desert as eternity, Man obliging his duties and enduring
the motions but inwardly gasping for breath, longing and failing, one
insignificant figure trickling across the majestic, colossal landscape, the
passing of time its only certainty, the characters' private, lifelong reach for
meaning externalized as sea-splitting spectacle, opens with this quote: "The
flag is still. The wind is calm. It is the heart of man that is in turmoil." In
the beginning, nature is still. For but an instant, the heart sings, and all
too quickly the bird's song fades, leaving the universe to its original
silence. But over the brow of enough mountains, exasperation settles into
peace: Wong Kar Wai said on a separate occasion, "There's a Chinese poem which
is very beautiful: 'The blossom will always be there, but the faces will
change.'" This beauty isn't from having no choice but to resign at the
inevitable that the world which once was ours is being involuntarily taken
away. It is the peaceful acquiescence after the long rage and denial in the
face of the ultimate loss, that of the self, when one is no longer standing
under the heavy rain but understands that no matter how heavy the rain, the sun
is always shining behind the dark clouds. Towards the end of Ozu's TOKYO STORY,
Setsuko Hara is asked earnestly by a younger woman, "Isn't life
disappointing?", to which she, having been widowed and having witnessed her
parents-in-law be left behind by their children as they pursue their own
interesting lives, as we all do, leaving the older generation to pass,
maintains her smile in the Japanese composure and reserve, a sadness under the
smile not even betrayed by the eyes, and replies without a thought, "Yes, it
is." Yes, in the melancholic, staid peace of wisdom, without flailing or garish
blathering or resorting to hedonist escapades, but merely calmly stepping
towards our turn when it comes.

<h4>2021-07-21, 三.</h4>
Giacometti created sculptures of the walking man, as towering as they are
thin—the walking man standing tall and confident, hurried in his stride, too
busy to pause at the mirror to see his own emptiness and insubstantial being,
just one passing evening wind. So too Gao Xingjian painted silhouettes of
vague, isolated wanderers placed in a ghostly, intangible, shifting, empty
landscape, pieces whose brushstrokes breathe fading life yet whose poignant
weight carries the same tone as Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL in which Man can
only dance around but never evade Death, only Gao Xingjian's figures are
nameless, faceless, unknowable, themselves forgettable and forgotten. These are
our parents, children, friends, and every soul that is presently inhaling air
who will in no time at all meet the same end as those who have long returned to
ash and soil. This is us, and the private, individual anguish can for just a
moment be soothed by recalling that prior generations have already crossed the
finish line, and we are merely continuing along at our own sweet pace. March
forth like the soldiers in Masaki Kobayashi's film trilogy THE HUMAN CONDITION,
whose marching line evokes Bergman's ending dance, because we are all in line
for the same twilight finale. All we can do is greet it and dash it the faint
human smile.

<h4>2021-06-29, 二. On Authenticity In Art, Politics, and Taxes.</h4>
David Foster Wallace mentioned a few interesting ideas when he said:
<blockquote>
Let me insert one thing, which I'll bet you've noticed from talking to writers,
is that most of the stuff we think we're writing about in books is very
difficult to talk about straight out, you know, question-and-answer, and in
some sense it probably can't be talked about directly, and that's why people
make up stories about it.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The idea of being a citizen would be to understand your country's history and
the things about it that are good and not so good and how the system works, and
taking the trouble to learn about candidates running for office . . . When
people don't do that, here's what happens. The candidates win who have the most
money to buy television advertisements because television advertisements are
all most voters know about the candidates. Therefore, we get candidates who are
beholden to large donors and become, in some ways, corrupt, which disgusts the
voters and makes the voters even less interested in politics, less willing to
do the work of citizenship . . . Talking about this now, I feel ashamed,
because my saying all this sounds like an older person saying this like a
person lecturing, which in American culture sets me up to be ridiculed. It
would be very easy to make fun of what I'm saying, and I can hear in my head a
voice making fun of this stuff as I'm saying it. And this is the kind of
paradox, I think, of what it is to be a halfway intelligent American right now
and probably also a Western European. There are things we know are right and
good and would be better for us to do, but constantly it's like, 'Yeah, but
it's so much funnier and nicer to go do something else, and who cares? It's all
bullshit anyway.' . . .  The paradox is that sort of tension and complication
and conflict in people also make them very easy to market to, because I can say
to you, 'Feeling uneasy? Life feels empty? Here's something you can buy or
something you can go do.'
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
There's probably more demand for serious books in Europe, but here there's a
small pocket of probably, I don't know, half a million, say a million readers,
many of whom are from the upper classes and have good educations and have been
taught the pleasures of hard work in reading or music or art and like that. I
mean, when you're talking to me, you're talking to someone who doesn't have
very much power in the culture and who's not very important except in a fairly
small—I don't know what the analogue would be. It would be something like
contemporary classical music in the U.S., which there are people who enjoy it
and listen to it, partly because of training and partly because they are
disposed to be willing to do a certain amount more work reading it. But
compared to popular music and rock and roll and hip-hop and stuff, classical
music is nothing, economically or commercially or in terms of how many people
have heard of it or how much an influence it has on the culture . . . I think
in the U.S., people who have been doing serious stuff, which is harder and
stranger, have always played to a much smaller audience . . . Reading requires
sitting alone in a quiet room, and I have friends, intelligent friends, who
don't like to read—it's not just bored—there's an almost dread that comes up
here about having to be alone and having to be quiet. And you see that when you
walk into most public spaces in America, it isn't quiet anymore. They pipe
music through, and the music is easy to make fun of because it's usually really
horrible music, but it seems significant that we don't want things to be quiet
ever anymore. And to me, I don't know if I can defend it, but that seems to me
to have something to do with, when you feel like the purpose of your life is to
gratify yourself and get things for yourself and go all the time, there's this
other part of you that's almost hungry for silence and quiet and thinking
really hard about the same thing for half an hour instead of thirty seconds,
that doesn't get fed at all . . . I think it's true that here in the U.S. every
year the culture gets more and more hostile. It becomes more and more difficult
to ask people to read, or to look at a piece of art for an hour, or to listen
to a piece of music that's complicated and that takes work to understand.

<blockquote>
In the United States, there is another divison, between corporate publishers
and non-profit publishers, who are often very small and do a lot of poetry and
avant-garde fiction. If you are 'lucky' enough to be published by a corporate
publisher, you get more exposure, you get reviewed in the New York Times
instead of just in your local paper, you get translated into other languages,
but literary stuff loses money for corporate publishers almost all the time,
and one of the ways they try to keep from losing money is marketing the
stuff—having the author go around and talk and read—the thing they most like to
do is send you to a bookstore and you give a reading . . . and that generates
free advertising for the book.
</blockquote>

Sally Rooney's take on it:
<blockquote>
Writers turn up to events full of people from a particular class, with a
particular educational background, and essentially the writer sells them the
product which is cultured existence in the form of a commodity, and the
commodity is a book. And people can purchase this book and therefore purchase
their way into a seemingly cultured class. And all the money that changes hands
in the book industry is actually just people paying to belong to a class of
people who read books.
</blockquote>

David Foster Wallace goes on:
<blockquote>
When there's a question-and-answer at the end of a reading, the question is
easy to answer if it's dull or stupid. The good questions are the questions that
can't be answered in a Q-and-A format. They're ones you have to sit down with a
pot of tea or a pot of coffee. They are things that can only be answered in
conversation between two people, and so I always feel vaguely fraudulent . . .
It makes me nervous and self-conscious to try to talk about stuff that I find
almost impossible to talk about, or else to just go, 'So how long are you in
town?'—'Oh, three days.' . . . The whole going around and reading in bookstores
thing, it's turning writers into penny-ante or cheap versions of celebrities.
People aren't usually coming out to hear you read. They're coming to see what
you look like and see whether your voice matches the voice that's in their head
when they read, and it's all—none of it is important.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If you do work like this, you pay certain prices. You don't make as much money,
not as many people read your stuff, but the people who are reading it and are
interested in it—the thing I like about doing this kind of stuff is that I'm
pretty sure my readers are about as smart as I am. I think if you're someone
like Crichton or someone who's a Harvard M.D. but you're writing for a mass
audience, things get very strange. I don't worry that people who are reading my
stuff are misunderstanding it or banalizing it . . . This is something else
about being an American. When I hear 'existential' now, half of me rolls my
eyes—'Oh, what a big sexy philosophical term.' And it becomes hard to speak
seriously about it because all I can hear is being made fun of how serious and
boring and dull I'm being.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I know that there's a paradox in the U.S. of, the people who get powerful jobs
tend to go to really good schools, and often in school you study the liberal
arts, which is philosophy, classical stuff, languages, and it's all very much
about the nobility of the human spirit and broadening the mind. And then from
that, you go to a specialized school to learn how to sue people or to figure
out how to write copy that will make people buy a certain kind of SUV . . . I'm
not sure really that it's ever been all that different. There are things about
my job that I don't like, but this is one of them I do like, is that I get to
use everything I've ever learned or think about . . . I know that there is, at
least in America, an entire class of—and now I'm talking about a very specific
class here—I'm talking about upper and upper-middle class kids whose parents
could afford to send them to very good schools where they got very good
educations, who are often working in jobs that are financially rewarding but
don't have anything to do with they got taught was important and worthwhile in
school.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
What it seems like here is that, television and corporate entertainment,
because it's so expensive, in order to make money it has to appeal to a very
wide audience. Which means it has to find things that a lot of people have in
common. What most of us have in common here are our very most base,
uninteresting, selfish, stupid interests—physical attractiveness, sex, a
certain kind of easy humor, vivid spectacle. That's stuff I will immediately
look at, and so will you. So it's in our very most base and childish interests
that make us a mass. The things that make us interesting and unique and human,
those interests tend to be wildly different between different people.
</blockquote>

David Foster Wallace said this in 2003. Not much has changed, and nor will it,
but indeed he suspected correctly that things have never really been all that
different. In 1880, Dostoyevsky wrote in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV:

<blockquote>
Taking freedom to mean the increase and prompt satisfaction of needs,
[people] distort their own nature, for they generate many meaningless and
foolish desires, habits, and the most absurd fancies in themselves. They live
only for mutual envy, for pleasure-seeking and self-display. To have dinners,
horses, carriages, rank, and slaves to serve them is now considered such a
necessity that for the sake of it, to satisfy it, they will sacrifice life,
honor, the love of mankind, and will even kill themselves if they are unable to
satisfy it . . . I ask you: is such a man free? . . . And therefore the idea of
serving mankind, of the brotherhood and oneness of people, is fading more and
more in the world, and indeed the idea now even meets with mockery, for how can
one drop one's habits, where will this slave go now that he is so accustomed to
satisfying the innumerable needs he himself has invented? He is isolated, and
what does he care about the whole? They have succeeded in amassing more and
more things, but have less and less joy.
</blockquote>

I'll now switch to politics. This first paragraph is directed not at sensible,
well-meaning Republicans but those who follow and agree with Tucker Carlson and
Laura Ingraham. Republicans, scream election fraud all you want; two can play
that game. Populists, if you are so wary of intellectuals, to science, to
thinking and evidence, do you go to the dentist when you have a toothache? To
the hospital when you have cancer? Trusting intellectuals is not socialism.
Physical distancing and wearing masks during a global pandemic caused by an
airborne virus is not socialism. Raising taxes on the rich is not socialism.
The personal income tax, corporate tax, and estate tax are not socialism. If
you think higher taxes for the rich also means higher taxes for struggling
farmers, you've been duped by people who sell their agenda by calling it your
individual liberty when they buy their islands, hide in their bunkers at the
outset of a pandemic, and, when Earth is not enough, race each other to fly
to space. How disgraceful have you become not only as a political party but
as people when you refuse to investigate an attack on your own Capitol? If
liberal-run cities are indeed rampant with violence and there is no law or
order, why do the educated still live there and continue generating the highest
economic output? Consider for a moment the possibility that those you revile as
intellectuals spend considerable time thinking about problems you yourself do
not, and sometimes facing truth requires putting aside blind national pride.
How is it possible with all the knowledge and advancements of modernity we have
in America a movement steeped in
<a href="https://www.studioatao.org/post/understanding-anti-intellectualism-in-the-u-s">anti-intellectualism</a>?
Let me get to the point. Religious fundamentalists teach distrust towards
intellectuals to silence alternative worldviews in an increasingly secular
society where they are losing power as their followers, becoming
self-sufficient, break away. And what happens when anti-intellectualism is
taken to the extreme? History offers a few data points. In 1915, Ottomans,
fearing Armenian independence, began their genocide first with the
intellectuals to remove leadership. In the 1960s Mao launched the Cultural
Revolution in China in which for a full decade academics, scientists,
professors, and any intellectual ranging from those employed in the
institutions down to recent college graduates, all associated with the
bourgeois, were implicated and were marched in public in humiliation, beaten,
killed, or sent to work on farms, and schools and universities were closed,
sending scholarship and literacy down a monumental backslide in a country that
had for many centuries prized education, all to consolidate power for himself
in the name of glorifying the people, whose descendants now are more drawn to
material excess than the humility of the long time prior. We in American have
not yet descended so low, but when the people elect someone who withdraws from
the WHO, seriously considers pulling out of NATO, promises to revive the coal
industry, and repeatedly disregards the recommendations of scientists during a
global pandemic, do we suppose we are heading in the right direction? In
antiquity, Plato advocated for a philosopher king, and through all the progress
we've made since then we've come to be threatened by duplicitous capitalists
appealing to irrational fear and incompetence. After the Capitol rioters
succeeded in seizing the building, looting and destroying, they meandered
about, having ridden the tide of hysteria and rage to find themselves without
any idea what to do next, pawns to someone afraid of losing power.

I'll now talk reasonably. This section talks about taxes and also, because this
topic relates to wealth, politics. Full disclosure: I'm not an economist or a
tax lawyer, nor do I believe I'm going to change anyone's views on this. The
question of whether the rich are already being taxed enough seems nearly as
difficult as the question of whether a God or gods exist. You already have an
answer you believe in, and what you see will either confirm your position or
raise your suspicion at its correctness. For those who like me are not experts
in tax research and who are interested in my side, which calls for equitable
redistribution of resources, the notable researchers are these French
economists:
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0IAgAnoAAAAJ&hl=en">Thomas Piketty</a>,
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qZpr_CQAAAAJ&hl=en">Emmanuel Saez</a>,
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GbOivREAAAAJ&hl=en">Gabriel Zucman</a>.
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PhDDPiUAAAAJ&hl=en">Raj Chetty</a>
also does promising and very interesting work on the country's inequality and
unequal access to opportunity. But case in point on the difficulty of the tax
question: in 2011 Saez, with Nobel laureate Peter Diamond, calculated that the
optimal tax rate for the highest income bracket in the U.S. is
<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.25.4.165">73%</a>.
Currently, it is
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/publications/federal-tax-rates-and-tax-brackets/#brackets">37%</a>.
The principle behind this high rate is optimal tax theory, which aims to
maximize everyone's well-being without inhibiting innovation. For comparison,
AOC's proposed tax rate is 70% on—this is key—only income higher than $10
million. The great majority of American families do not reach that threshold.
Then, a paper like
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2550936">this</a>
points out the logistical impracticalities of raising taxes.
And
<a href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/optimal-top-tax-rates-review-critique">this</a>
from Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, modifies two parameters in the
model. The author writes of the original paper, "They argued that, if the
Pareto parameter is 1.5 and the ETI is 0.25, then 'τ* = 1/(1 + 1.5 × 0.25) = 73
percent'. If that formula is accepted uncritically, then the conclusion follows
from the premises. But neither the formula itself, nor the two parameters
(Pareto and elasticity) need be accepted uncritically. If this was a recipe for
baking a cake, it might be prudent to question both the recipe and the
ingredients." The author also writes, "with empirically credible changes in
parameters, the Diamond‐Saez formula can more easily be used to show that top
U.S. federal, state, and local tax rates are already too high rather than too
low." However, the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank
supports the high rate,
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-income-taxes/">writing</a>,
"The policy implications of this research are that increasing top marginal tax
rates can raise substantial sums of revenue and potentially dampen the rise of
income inequality without unduly restraining economic growth." I think this
kind of disagreement is ridiculous. For comparison, even though machine
learning research has a lot of bloat and myriad models, parameters, and
modifications to explore, at the end of the day there is consensus on a model's
performance because researchers don't question the evaluation metrics. But when
it comes to taxes, because money is involved, where a right-leaning think tank
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/rich-pay-their-fair-share-of-taxes/">says</a>
the rich are already paying their fair share, a left-leaning one has
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/decades-of-rising-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s-testimony-before-the-u-s-house-of-representatives-ways-and-means-committee/#share">data</a>
suggesting they don't. Opposing
<a href="https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/1-chart-how-much-the-rich-pay-taxes">these</a>
facts are also
<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-fairness-briefing-booklet/fact-sheet-corporate-tax-rates/">these</a>.
And what does the public think? One
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/04/growing-partisan-divide-over-fairness-of-the-nations-tax-system/">poll</a>
shows 62% of Americans say that it bothers them a lot that some wealthy people
don't pay their fair share, and that views on the country's tax system is
increasingly colored by political affiliation.

I think the interesting question isn't: Are the rich paying their fair share of
income taxes? but rather: Why is inequality still rising when the rich are
already paying so much? By "so much", I mean the fact that in 2018 the top 1%,
according to the two conservatives' links at the end of the paragraph above, the
numbers also corroborated by another Tax Foundation
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/publications/latest-federal-income-tax-data/">article</a>,
earned 21% of all income but paid 40% of federal income taxes, and the top 10%
earned 48% of the income but paid 71% of the taxes. Before I go further, I
think it's important to put these numbers in perspective. Using a flat rate for
simplicity, taxing 20% on someone making $100,000 does not have the same effect
on the standard of living as 20% on someone making $10,000,000, which would
produce a much larger share of the taxes between the two. I think the answer to
this question: Do the rich pay their fair share of income taxes? is: yes. But
this is not the right question because income is only part of the picture. You
might wonder how inequality is still rising if the wealthy pay their fair share
of income taxes. Conservatives are hesitant to talk about the other variable:
existing wealth. The real equation of annual net worth growth is:

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white; text-align:center;">
net worth growth = income + wealth growth - debt growth
</pre>

where

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
income = salay, wages, interest, dividends, etc.
wealth growth = stock appreciation, real estate appreciation, etc.
</pre>

Among the rich, wealth growth dominates. I'm going to focus on wealth growth
from stocks which, in our current system, favors those who already own them,
and those with more shares benefit disproportionately from rising values and
begin to own more and more, i.e. the game is rigged. Piketty wrote a more
complete discussion on this kind of growing inequality in CAPITAL IN THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. Piketty traced the history of wealth and inequality and
observed that when investment growth alone outpaces the rest of the economy,
the inevitable end is rising inequality. His recommended solution is a
progressive wealth tax, which is what I also believe in. It is crucial to keep
in mind that the wealth tax is separate from the income tax most people are
familiar with. The wealth tax is imposed on already acquired wealth which for
the rich is the main instrument for wealth growth, a method that is out of
reach of most Americans. The U.S. has never had a wealth tax, and it is not
hard to imagine who might go to extraordinary lengths to prevent one and why
they might call it unconstitutional.

In 2019, the Federal Reserve released a
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019017pap.pdf">paper</a>
describing the rising wealth inequality:
<blockquote>
At the highest level, the
[Distributed Financial Accounts] show significant wealth concentration and a
clear increase in wealth concentration since 1989 . . . In 2018, the top 10% of
U.S. households controlled 70 percent of total household wealth, up from 60
percent in 1989. The share of the top 1% of the wealth distribution increased
from 23 percent to nearly 32 percent from 1989 to 2018. The increase in the
wealth share of the top 10% came at the expense of households in the 50th to
90th percentiles of the wealth distribution, whose share decreased from 36
percent to 29 percent over this period. The bottom 50% of the wealth
distribution experienced virtually no increase in their nominal net worth over
the last 30 years, resulting in a fall in total wealth share from 4 percent in
1989 to just 1 percent in 2018. The rise in wealth concentration stems
primarily from increased concentration of assets, with trends for assets
largely mimicking those for overall wealth. The share of assets held by the top
10% of the wealth distribution rose from 55 percent to 64 percent since 1989,
with asset shares increasing the most for the top 1% of households. These
increases were mirrored by decreases for households in the 50-90th percentiles
of the wealth distribution. we observe that the share of real estate held by
the top 10% of the wealth distribution has increased by 5 percentage points
from 39 percent to 44 percent, suggesting that increases in wealthy households'
share of real estate holdings have contributed to the increase in
concentration. Corporate and noncorporate business equity have been large
drivers of wealth concentration. The distribution of these assets has long been
skewed: in 1989, the richest 10% of households held 80 percent of corporate
equity and 78 percent of equity in noncorporate business. Since 1989, the top
10%'s share of corporate equity has increased, on net, from 80 percent to 87
percent, and their share of noncorporate business equity has increased, on net,
from 78 percent to 86 percent. Furthermore, most of these increases in business
equity holdings have been realized by the top 1%, whose corporate equity shares
increased from 39 percent to 50 percent and noncorporate equity shares
increased from 42 percent to 53 percent since 1989.

The paper contains charts of the data, but it's easier to go to an
interactive version for the
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WFRBST01122,WFRBSN09149,WFRBSN40176,WFRBSB50203">stock dataset</a>
from the Federal Reserve's database. We see that stocks are predominantly owned
by the wealthy, and their share has grown in the last 30 years. The share
among the top 10% in Q1 1991 was 79.7% and rose in Q1 2021 to 88.7%. We also
see that since at least as far back as 1989, the bottom 50% have never owned
more than 1.6% and in 2021 owned 0.6%, which is next to nothing. Another
dataset shows the
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WFRBST01134,WFRBSN09161,WFRBSN40188,WFRBSB50215">net worth distribution</a>,
and the same pattern emerges. The share among the top 10% in Q1 1991 was 60.3%
and rose in Q1 2021 to 69.8%. The bottom 50% never owned more than 4.1% since
1989 and in 2021 owned a mere 2%. The Pew Research Center also has
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/psdt_01-10-20_economic-inequality_1-4/">data</a>
showing the growing wealth inequality. When we also account for wealth, the
question "Do the rich pay their fair share?" takes on a different meaning. The
income tax numbers that conservatives toss about are only skirting around the
issue. That the top 10% earned 48% of one year's income but paid 71% of the
year's taxes no longer puts the burden on the poor when we see that the bottom
50% have almost nothing to tax. According to the Tax Policy Center,
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-fact/income-salaries-and-wages-ff-06212021">the portion of income</a>
from salaries and wages also diverges by income class. For households with an
adjusted gross income less than $500,000, most (71%-81%) of the income came
from salaries and wages—from working. For households whose AGI is at least $10
million, that portion shrinks to 17%. The majority of their income likely comes
from bond interest and dividends—from their wealth by either investing or
owning shares of their own company. Inequality also plays out in college
admissions. An
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">article</a>
from the Times visualizes data from a study co-authored by Raj Chetty and Saez,
finding that:
<blockquote>
[a]t 38 colleges in America, including five in the Ivy League . . . more
students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire
bottom 60 percent. Roughly one in four of the richest students attend an elite
college – universities that typically cluster toward the top of annual
rankings. In contrast, less than one-half of 1 percent of children from the
bottom fifth of American families attend an elite college; less than half
attend any college at all.
</blockquote>

It is important to distinguish between groups within the top 1%, which has its
own massive internal inequalities. The Chicago Booth Review has an
<a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent">article</a>
that differentiates the average income in 2015 between four segments in the
top 1%, and even in this echelon, the wealthier acquire wealth faster; each
step from one group to its next higher group is a jump on an exponential curve,
from $485 thousand to $901 thousand to $2.9 million to $18.9 million. The
richest group, the 0.01%, are the 1 percenters of the 1 percent. Inequality.org
gives a more concrete look at the wealthy, splitting the top 10% into five
groups and gave a brief descriptive
<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/taxing-rich-starts-knowing-who-they-are/">profile</a>
of each one. One investment manager suggests that there is a large divide
between the bottom and top halves of the top 1%. In 2011 he
<a href="https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/investment_manager.html">emailed</a>
Bill Domhoff at WHO RULES AMERICA? the trouble he saw in the economy's
inequality, particularly as caused by the top 0.5%. He remained anonymous to
protect his identity since his clients are primarily the ones he is
criticizing, as they "largely fall into the top 1%, have a net worth of
$5,000,000 or above, and — if working — make over $300,000 per year." He writes
of the lower half:
<blockquote>
The 99th to 99.5th percentiles largely include physicians, attorneys, upper
middle management, and small business people who have done well . . . The net
worth for those in the lower half of the top 1% is usually achieved after
decades of education, hard work, saving and investing as a professional or
small business person. While an after-tax income of $175k to $250k and net
worth in the $1.2M to $1.8M range may seem like a lot of money to most
Americans, it doesn't really buy freedom from financial worry or access to the
true corridors of power and money. That doesn't become frequent until we reach
the top 0.1% . . . Our poor lower half of the top 1% lives well but has some
financial worries. Since the majority of those in this group actually earned
their money from professions and smaller businesses, they generally don't
participate in the benefits big money enjoys. Those in the 99th to 99.5th
percentile lack access to power . . . Unlike those in the lower half of the top
1%, those in the top half and, particularly, top 0.1%, can often borrow for
almost nothing, keep profits and production overseas, hold personal assets in
tax havens, ride out down markets and economies, and influence legislation in
the U.S. They have access to the very best in accounting firms, tax and other
attorneys, numerous consultants, private wealth managers, a network of other
wealthy and powerful friends, lucrative business opportunities, and many other
benefits. Most of those in the bottom half of the top 1% lack power and global
flexibility and are essentially well-compensated workhorses for the top 0.5%,
just like the bottom 99%. In my view, the American dream of striking it rich is
merely a well-marketed fantasy that keeps the bottom 99.5% hoping for better
and prevents social and political instability. The odds of getting into that
top 0.5% are very slim and the door is kept firmly shut by those within it.
</blockquote>
The investment manager then describes the upper half:
<blockquote>
Membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some
aspect of the financial services or banking industry, real estate development
involved with those industries, or government contracting. Some hard working
and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as $15M-$20M before
retirement but they are rare. Those in the top 0.5% have incomes over $500k if
working and a net worth over $1.8M if retired. The higher we go up into the top
0.5% the more likely it is that their wealth is in some way tied to the
investment industry and borrowed money than from personally selling goods or
services or labor as do most in the bottom 99.5%. They are much more likely to
have built their net worth from stock options and capital gains in stocks and
real estate and private business sales, not from income which is taxed at a
much higher rate. These opportunities are largely unavailable to the bottom
99.5% . . . The picture is clear; entry into the top 0.5% and, particularly,
the top 0.1% is usually the result of some association with the financial
industry and its creations. I find it questionable as to whether the majority
in this group actually adds value or simply diverts value from the US economy
and business into its pockets and the pockets of the uber-wealthy who hire
them. They are, of course, doing nothing illegal . . . A highly complex set of
laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the
uppermost reaches of the U.S. financial system. It allows them to protect and
increase their wealth and significantly affect the U.S. political and
legislative processes. They have real power and real wealth. Ordinary citizens
in the bottom 99.9% are largely not aware of these systems, do not understand
how they work, are unlikely to participate in them, and have little likelihood
of entering the top 0.5%, much less the top 0.1%. Moreover, those at the very
top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules. I am not
optimistic.
</blockquote>
In a 2014 addendum, the investment manager wrote:
<blockquote>
One might think that physicians, America's highest-paid professional group,
would be largely exempt from the economic currents affecting most other
Americans. This isn't so. Medscape, a key physician website, reports that as of
2013, mean income for male physicians in all specialties was $259k; for female
physicians, it was $199k. Family practice doctors and internists earned the
least, averaging around $175k. Orthopedic surgeons earned the most, averaging
around $405k; they are the only physician specialty falling within the top 1%
by income . . . If our hypothetical physician saves and invests for 35 years,
he will have contributed less than $2 million dollars to retirement plans . . .
Thus, an average physician — while doing very well by most people's standards —
is unlikely to earn or accumulate enough to place him or her in the top 1% by
income or net worth at the end of their career. Opportunity for most Americans,
even physicians, is decreasing, even while net worth and income accelerate for
those at the very top of the system. If an average physician today is unlikely
to make it into the top 1% (Piketty and Saez's end-of-2012 data show that the
1% income line is crossed with an income of $396k per year), then it seems
pretty clear that crossing that line via income, savings, and investments will
be impossible for nearly every American in the future.

He wrote also about someone who put up with finance enough to retire early, and
her account of investment banking reminded me of academia, only the currency
there is not money, and there's not so much as damage to anything as a large
part of it will never see the light of day and has no other purpose than
publication:
<blockquote>
Recently, I spoke with a younger client who retired from a major
investment bank in her early thirties, net worth around $8M. Since I knew she
held a critical view of investment banking, I asked if her colleagues talked
about or understood how much damage was created in the broader economy from
their activities. Her answer was that no one talks about it in public but
almost all understood and were unbelievably cynical, hoping to exit the system
when they became rich enough.
</blockquote>

What does net worth growth look like for those in the highest echelon? Let's
look at Stephen Schwarzman's in 2020. I have nothing personal against
Schwarzman; he has a history of philanthropy, and he's signed The Giving
Pledge. I'm just using his wealth as an example. According to Reuters,
Schwarzman
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackstone-group-ceo-compensation/blackstone-ceo-schwarzman-took-home-610-5-million-in-2020-idUSKBN2AT2V7">received</a>
$86.4 million in compensation and $524.1 million in dividends from his
Blackstone shares, for a total income of at least $610.5 million. What about
his wealth growth, considering solely his earnings from Blackstone? According
to the same link, he owns 19.3% of Blackstone, which had
<a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/BX/shares_outstanding">682.91 million</a>
shares outstanding in 2/2020, so he owned 131.8 million shares. Using stock
price
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BX/">data</a>
from Yahoo Finance:

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">

       $53.84                  $64.81              $10.97           $1.4B
</pre>

Forbes
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/stephen-schwarzman/?sh=ffc2fea234a2">shows</a>
his net worth in 4/2020 was $15.4 billion and rose to $19.1 billion in 9/2020,
so he has more earnings than from Blackstone alone. Because the government does
not tax wealth, it is only when Schwarzman sells his shares that his earnings
get taxed. If Schwarzman holds on to his shares for at least a year, which he
already has, he avoids paying the higher rates of the ordinary
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#brackets">tax brackets</a>
and gets charged
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#capgains">lower rates</a>.
But what happens if Schwarzman doesn't sell his stocks? From a recent ProPublica
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">report</a>:
<blockquote>
The notion of dying as a tax benefit seems paradoxical. Normally when someone
sells an asset, even a minute before they die, they owe 20% capital gains tax.
But at death, that changes. Any capital gains till that moment are not taxed.
This allows the ultrarich and their heirs to avoid paying billions in taxes.
The 'step-up in basis' is widely recognized by experts across the political
spectrum as a flaw in the code.
</blockquote>
Dividends from stocks, however, do count as taxable income, but investors can
avoid that burden by choosing companies that reinvest in themselves rather than
pay dividends; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway does not pay dividends. If
the rich avoid receiving income, how do they pay for their large purchases?
I've not yet mentioned the third variable in the net worth growth equation:
debt. It turns out that if you're ultrawealthy, you can borrow money to avoid
taxes. According to the same ProPublica report:
<blockquote>
For regular people, borrowing money is often something done out of necessity,
say for a car or a home. But for the ultrawealthy, it can be a way to access
billions without producing income, and thus, income tax. The tax math provides
a clear incentive for this. If you own a company and take a huge salary, you'll
pay 37% in income tax on the bulk of it. Sell stock and you'll pay 20% in
capital gains tax — and lose some control over your company. But take out a
loan, and these days you'll pay a single-digit interest rate and no tax; since
loans must be paid back, the IRS doesn't consider them income. Banks typically
require collateral, but the wealthy have plenty of that.

Abigail Disney, an heiress of the Disney family, is among the exceptions in
America's aristocrats in that she has a conscience to admit the failings of the
system. She
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/abigail-disney-rich-protect-dynastic-wealth-propublica-tax/619212/">writes</a>
in The Atlantic a response to the ProPublica report:
<blockquote>
Nowhere does ProPublica assert that these men cheated, lied, or did anything
felonious to lower their tax burdens. The naked fact of the matter is that not
a single one of the documented methods and practices that allowed these
billionaires to so radically minimize their tax obligations was illegal. What's
worse, these methods and practices—things such as offsetting income with losses
in unrelated businesses; structuring assets to grow rather than generate
income, then borrowing against those growing assets for cash needs; and
deducting interest payments and state taxes from taxable income—are so
downright mundane and commonly applied that most rich people don't see them as
unethical. The more interesting question is not how the men in ProPublica's
report were able to avoid paying much or anything in federal income taxes, but
why. What motivates people with so much money to try to withhold every last bit
of it from the public's reach? . . . Having money—a lot of money—is very, very
nice. It's damn hard to resist the seductions of what money buys you. I've
never been much of a materialist, but I have wallowed in the less concrete
privileges that come with a trust fund, such as time, control, security,
attention, power, and choice. The fact is, this is pretty standard software
that comes with the hardware of a human body. As time has passed, I have
realized that the dynamics of wealth are similar to the dynamics of addiction.
The more you have, the more you need. Whereas once a single beer was enough to
achieve a feeling of calm, now you find that you can't stop at six. Likewise,
if you move up from coach to business to first class, you won't want to go back
to coach. And once you've flown private, wild horses will never drag you
through a public airport terminal again. Comforts, once gained, become
necessities. And if enough of those comforts become necessities, you eventually
peel yourself away from any kind of common feeling with the rest of humanity.
The older I've gotten and the more clearly I've understood these things, the
more the impulse to betray my own class has taken charge of my judgment. What's
shocking about the ProPublica report is not just that the tax bills are so low,
but that these billionaires can live with themselves.

Abigail Disney also references David Foster Wallace's THIS IS WATER commencement
speech in 2005 at Kenyon College, during which some in the audience laughed in
humor at certain points from the habit of watching too many sitcoms without
realizing the brutal reality of what was being said, provoking a rage like
watching an arthouse film among a jovial audience that has no idea what's
being shown on screen, and then realizing not everyone comes from your
background, sighing in resignation, and recalling that we are all nothing: "All
I know is that if you are a fish, it is hard to describe water, much less to
ask if water is necessary, ethical, and structured the way it ought to be."

To an average American family earning $70,000 a year, an additional $10,000
makes a sizable impact. To someone in this stratosphere, an additional million
or two makes no meaningful difference. In the end, there are two choices for
the ultrawealthy: 1) signing
<a href="https://givingpledge.org/">The Giving Pledge</a>
to give to charity most of the fortunes made in their lifetimes by their own
accomplishment, which Schwarzman and Buffett have done, and 2) starting a new
capitalist dynasty like these
<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-richest-families-in-america/">families</a>
whose heirs know it is best to stay away from the limelight, instead protecting
their wealth by calling for lower taxes and lobbying in various forms, such as
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/estatetaxfinal.pdf">repealing</a>
the estate tax, calling it the death tax to scare the common American to whom
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-many-people-pay-estate-tax">the tax would never apply</a>.

The wealth tax isn't a new idea; it's already been proposed in politics. Bernie
Sanders
<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/">proposes</a>
a wealth tax that would:
<blockquote>
only apply to net worth of over $32 million and anyone who has a net worth of
less than $32 million, would not see their taxes go up at all under this plan.
This tax on extreme wealth would have a progressive rate structure that would
only apply to the wealthiest 180,000 households in America who are in the top
0.1 percent. It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million
for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay
a wealth tax of just $5,000. The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net
worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent
from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent
from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on
wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles. Under this
plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would
substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small
privileged class.
</blockquote>
This last sentence, of course, would not make the referenced class happy.
Elizabeth Warren's more lenient
<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax">version</a>
of the wealth tax raises the minimum threshold at which the tax starts and has
lower rates: "Zero additional tax on any household with a net worth of less
than $50 million (99.9% of American households)." The tax for the wealthy
is: "2% annual tax on household net worth between $50 million and $1 billion",
and for billionaires: "4% annual Billionaire Surtax (6% tax overall) on
household net worth above $1 billion". Furthermore, research suggests that more
equitable distribution of economic growth leads to more opportunity for all.
Raj Chetty
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6336/398.full">found</a>
that:
<blockquote>
rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children
born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates
experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP
growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would
reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that
reviving the 'American dream' of high rates of absolute mobility would require
economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.
</blockquote>
We have data that confirm that taxes successfully redistribute income and reduce
inequality. Our World in Data
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality#redistribution-through-tax-and-transfer-policies">visualized</a>
income distributions before and after taxes, as they currently stand, for
multiple countries and found that "inequality is not only reduced by
redistribution between individuals at a given point in time, but also by
achieving redistribution over the course of life." OWID also has an
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-inequality-gini-index?tab=chart&country=USA~FRA~DNK~DEU~ISL~GBR~CHE~SWE~ITA~NOR">interactive visualization</a>
comparing inequality between the U.S. and several European countries. The U.S.
notably has the highest inequality, and lowest inequality is in the group of
Scandinavian countries which have higher taxes to support a broader system of
government services.

I should mention explicitly that I do not support socialism. It didn't work out
well for the countries that ran that experiment, but unbridled capitalism leads
to growing inequality and does not yield equal opportunity for all. Inequality
is presumed and necessary in capitalism, but what is the right level of
inequality? One
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437115003738">paper</a>
proposed that the fairest inequality is a lognormal distribution. The paper
hasn't generated much interest, and I suspect this is a hard problem, not to
mention the politics involved, so this question is not one I'm going to
explore.

I don't think the main driver of the economy relates solely to taxation, but a
classic Republican claim is that lower taxes jumpstarts the economy. I'm not
convinced. If an old-school Republican points to Reagan's economic success by
lowering taxes, I'll point out that Clinton did better
in terms of
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Presidential_Comparison_Real_GDP_-_v1.png">GDP</a>
and
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Job_Growth_by_U.S._President_-_v1.png">job growth</a> with higher taxes on the
wealthy. The Federal Reserve has job growth
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USPRIV">data</a>
since 1939 in absolute terms. Clinton did
<a href="https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/textonly/WH/Accomplishments/Small_Business.html">lower taxes</a>
for businesses, but it was for small businesses, not the wealthy. It certainly
wasn't a trickle-down utopia. And Mike Pence recently
<a href="https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/bidens-china-first-tax-plan-americans-come-last-presidents-jobs-plan">wrote</a>:
<blockquote>
Under the Trump-Pence administration, we proved that low taxes are the key to
creating prosperity for Americans of every background and income group. In
2017, we passed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which delivered more than
$3.2 trillion in tax relief to American families and businesses. Within months,
our economy took off like a rocket. America gained more than 7 million new
jobs, unemployment plummeted to the lowest rate in 50 years, and more than 10
million people were lifted off of welfare—the largest reduction in poverty in
modern history.
</blockquote>
Actually, they didn't prove anything. The two job growth links above put Pence's
claims in context. In addition, we can compare Trump's numbers and Obama's.
FactCheck.org
<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/obamas-final-numbers/">summarized</a>
the numbers at the end of Obama's
term: "The economy gained a net 11.6 million jobs. The unemployment rate
dropped to below the historical norm." The numbers Pence mentions were not caused by Trump's
TCJA. The unemployment rate data
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE">show</a>
that by the time Trump took office, unemployment was already in decline, a trend
Obama started when he became president in 2009 immediately after the recession.
If Trump improved on Obama's performance, we would see a steep drop in
unemployment starting in 2017, but we don't. Again, Trump's TCJA didn't prove
anything. What about Biden's tax proposal? Lately there's been a lot of
intimidating news about it, with some calling it outright socialism. I will not
give them more coverage by linking to them, but Biden's tax hike is not
socialism. According to the Tax Foundation's
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/biden-tax-plan-tracker/">Biden tax tracker</a>,
Biden's tax hike to fund his infrastructure plan would "raise the top marginal income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent".
How does this compare to the historic rates? The Tax Policy Center has
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates">tabulated</a>
the top marginal rate from 1913 to 2020. Biden's new rate of 39.6% is the same
as Clinton's when he was in office between 1993 and 2001. What Biden is
proposing is not socialism. For a complete listing of the tax bracket history,
the Tax Foundation has a
<a href="https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/fed_individual_rate_history_nominal.pdf">document</a>
that shows all the rates between 1913 and 2013. Furthermore, no one called the
taxes socialism in the 1950s when the top marginal rate was 91%. To be fair,
this high rate should be construed with a grain of salt because in fact the
effective tax rate for the rich was not much higher than it is these days. One
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/">analysis</a>
shows that "between 1950 and 1959, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an
average of 42.0 percent of their income in federal, state, and local taxes.
Since then, the average effective tax rate of the top 1 percent has declined
slightly overall. In 2014, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an average tax
rate of 36.4 percent." This was perhaps because few households fell into the
top bracket or simply due to tax evasion. However, my point is that even the
91% rate of the 1950s was not rampantly labeled socialism the way Biden's
proposal currently is. It's not socialism. The Tax Policy Center has also
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/biden-would-raise-taxes-substantially-high-income-households-and-corporations-cut-taxes">analyzed</a>
Biden's tax increases: "Nearly all of President Biden's proposed tax increases
would be borne by the highest income 1 percent of households—those making about
$800,000 or more . . . At the same time, Biden would cut taxes for many low-
and moderate-income households and reduce them substantially for those with
children." All the scare about impending doom sounds to me like the wealthy
don't want to pay more taxes to help relieve the country's inequality.

The idea of fixing economic inequality is only a start. This is the solution
that's obvious in light of the data, and it's what progressives push for, yet
policy changes, redistributing wealth, and improving opportunities are not
adequate solutions when we assume we understand the working class without
actually seeing their perspective and troubles. If you are reading this, you in
all likelihood are not in this class. David Shipler's THE WORKING POOR:
INVISIBLE IN AMERICA offers a profile:
<blockquote>
The man who washes cars does not own one. The clerk who files cancelled checks
at the bank has $2.02 in her account. The woman who copyedits medical textbooks
has not been to a dentist in a decade. This is the forgotten America. At the
bottom of its working world, millions live in the shadow of prosperity, in the
twilight between poverty and well-being. Whether you're rich, poor, or
middle-class, you encounter them every day . . . Those with luck or talent step
onto career ladders toward better and better positions at higher and higher
pay. Many more, however, are stuck at such low wages that their living
standards are unchanged. They still cannot save, cannot get decent health care,
cannot move to better neighborhoods, and cannot send their children to schools
that offer a promise for a successful future. These are the forgotten
Americans, who are noticed and counted as they leave welfare, but who disappear
from the nation's radar as they struggle in their working lives. Breaking away
and moving a comfortable distance from poverty seems to require a perfect
lineup of favorable conditions. A set of skills, a good starting wage, and a
job with the likelihood of promotion are prerequisites. But so are clarity of
purpose, courageous self-esteem, a lack of substantial debt, the freedom from
illness or addiction, a functional family, a network of upstanding friends, and
the right help from private or governmental agencies. Any gap in that array is
an entry point for trouble, because being poor means being unprotected. You
might as well try playing quarterback with no helmet, no padding, no training,
and no experience, behind a line of hundred-pound weaklings. With no cushion of
money, no training in the ways of the wider world, and too little defense
against the threats and temptations of decaying communities, a poor man or
woman gets sacked again and again—buffeted and bruised and defeated. When an
exception breaks this cycle of failure, it is called the fulfillment of the
American Dream . . . The working individuals in this book are neither helpless
nor omnipotent, but stand on various points along the spectrum between the
polar opposites of personal and societal responsibility. Each person's life is
the mixed product of bad choices and bad fortune, of roads not taken and roads
cut off by the accident of birth or circumstance. It is difficult to find
someone whose poverty is not somehow related to his or her unwise behavior—to
drop out of school, to have a baby out of wedlock, to do drugs, to be
chronically late to work. And it is difficult to find behavior that is not
somehow related to the inherited conditions of being poorly parented, poorly
educated, poorly housed in neighborhoods from which no distant horizon of
possiblity can been seen . . . For practically every family, then, the
ingredients of poverty are part financial and part psychological, part personal
and part societal, part past and part present. Every problem magnifies the
impact of the others, and all are so tightly interlocked that one reversal can
produce a chain reaction with results far distant from the original cause. A
run-down apartment can exacerbate a child's asthma, which leads to a call for
an ambulance, which generates a medical bill that cannot be paid, which ruins a
credit record, which hikes the interest rate on an auto loan, which forces the
purchase of an unreliable used car, which jeopardizes a mother's punctuality at
work, which limits her promotion and earning capacity, which confines her to
poor housing. If she or any other impoverished working parent added up all her
individual problems, the whole would be equal to more than the sum of its
parts.
</blockquote>
Shipler wrote this in 2004 after spending time with people living in poverty.
The people he wrote about were demographically representative, across gender
and race. A more recent book provides the view specifically into the white
working class who support Trump, and policies would not help them without
knowing their problem, that their stresses cause them to dissociate from
participation, that, for many, they cannot see it in themselves to improve.
J.D. Vance writes of Appalachia's despair in HILLBILLY ELEGY:
<blockquote>
This isn't some libertarian mistrust of government policy, which is healthy in
any democracy. This is deep skepticism of the very institutions of our society.
And it's becoming more and more mainstream. We can't trust the evening news. We
can't trust our politicians. Our universities, the gateway to a better life,
are rigged against us. We can't get jobs. You can't believe these things and
participate meaningfully in society. Social psychologists have shown that group
belief is a powerful motivator in performance. When groups perceive that it's
in their interest to work hard and achieve things, members of that group
outperform other similarly situated individuals. It's obvious why: If you
believe that hard work pays off, then you work hard; if you think it's hard to
get ahead even when you try, then why try at all? Similarly, when people do
fail, this mind-set allows them to look outward. I once ran into an old
acquaintance at a Middletown bar who told me that he had recently quit his job
because he was sick of waking up early. I later saw him complaining on Facebook
about the 'Obama economy' and how it had affected his life. I don't doubt that
the Obama economy has affected many, but this man is assuredly not among them.
His status in life is directly attributable to the choices he's made, and his
life will improve only through better decisions. But for him to make better
choices, he needs to live in an environment that forces him to ask tough
questions about himself. There is a cultural movement in the white working
class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains
adherents by the day. Here is where the rhetoric of modern conservatives (and I
say this as one of them) fails to meet the real challenges of their biggest
constituents. Instead of encouraging engagement, conservatives increasingly
foment the kind of detachment that has sapped the ambition of so many of my
peers. I have watched some friends blossom into successful adults and others
fall victim to the worst of Middletown's temptations—premature parenthood,
drugs, incarceration. What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are
the expectations that they had for their own lives. Yet the message of the
right is increasingly: It's not your fault that you're a loser; it's the
government's fault.
</blockquote>
This feeling extends to the broader white working class. Arlie Russell
Hochschild called this feeling STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LAND:
<blockquote>
You are patiently standing in a long line leading up a hill, as in a pilgrimage.
You are situated in the middle of this line, along with others who are also
white, older, Christian, predominantly male, some with college degrees, some
not. Just over the brow of the hill is the American Dream, the goal of everyone
waiting in line . . . You've suffered long hours, layoffs, and exposure to
dangerous chemicals at work, and received reduced pensions. You have shown
moral character through trial by fire, and the American Dream of prosperity and
security is a reward for all of this, showing who you have been and are—a badge
of honor . . . Look! You see people cutting in line ahead of you! You're
following the rules. They aren't. As they cut in, it feels like you are being
moved back. How can they just do that? Who are they? Some are black. Through
affirmative action plans, pushed by the federal government, they are being
given preference for places in colleges and universities, apprenticeships,
jobs, welfare payments, and free lunches . . . Women, immigrants, refugees,
public sector workers—where will it end? Your money is running through a
liberal sympathy sieve you don't control or agree with . . . But it's people
like you who have made this country great. You feel uneasy. It has to be said:
the line cutters irritate you . . . You are a stranger in your own land. You do
not recognize yourself in how others see you. It is a struggle to feel seen and
honored . . .[Y]ou are slipping backward.
</blockquote>
It is this is feeling that found a voice in Trump in whom belated identification
has become hope, in whom anger has been given an authorized outlet. What's a
possible solution? I'm not qualified to offer one.

But strangers—Shipler also wrote a book about them, though through a racial
lens: A COUNTRY OF STRANGERS: BLACKS AND WHITES IN AMERICA. It was published
when I was 4, and I can still remember clearly the night of December 3, 1997
when my celestial glory, newspaper and coffee in hand, sat down in front of the
TV, eagerly waiting for him to appear on C-SPAN. Clinton, then president, was
holding a town hall to discuss race, and a recording is now available online.
The snippet I'm talking about is between 28:09 and 44:13, and this
<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?96122-1/town-meeting-race&start=1689">link</a>
defaults to its start. Shipler said:
<blockquote>
I feel that we're in a different phase of race relations in this country than we
used to be, and in some ways it's a more complicated phase. Bigotry, for the
most part, is not as blatant and obvious and outrageous as it used to be. A lot
of it has gone underground. It takes subtler forms, encrypted forms. Prejudice
is a shapeshifter. It's very agile in taking forms that seem acceptable on the
surface . . . I think for us as white Americans to understand some of this, we
have to reflect on some of the differences in experiences we've had as opposed
to those that Blacks and other minorities have had . . . I think in a dialogue
of this kind, the key is to listen, not just to talk . . . I'm hoping that if
we listen to each other, we can begin to diminish the size of that chasm and
perhaps even make this society of ours into less and less of a country of
strangers.
</blockquote>
Clinton added, "I don't think there is any legal policy answer to this. I think
this is something we've really got to work our way through." Beverly Daniel
Tatum was present too and said, "There's a lot of silence about these issues,
and I think breaking this silence is something many people are afraid of doing.
And as you pointed out we can't really fix this problem or continue the
improvement until we're able to engage in honest dialogue about that." On the
opposing side, Abigail Thernstrom, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a
conservative think tank, spoke about how far we've come since the 1960s and how
integrated the country had become. I think she meant well, but I think when you
pick certain data points, you can paint a better picture than how things are,
and relying on surveys for issues like race reveals less about outcomes and
behaviors than the prevailing fashionable attitudes of the time. When it's hot
out, it won't help to check the weather channel if your house is burning. Show
me your data, and I can show you segregation on a
<a href="http://racialdotmap.demographics.coopercenter.org">map</a>
based on the 2010 Census,
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/2/711/5687353">research</a>
that finds "differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth
explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income", and
a
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3320738/">study</a>
that:
<blockquote>
measured implicit and explicit attitudes about race using the Race Attitude
Implicit Association Test (IAT) for a large sample of test takers (N =
404,277), including a sub-sample of medical doctors (MDs) (n = 2,535). Medical
doctors, like the entire sample, showed an implicit preference for White
Americans relative to Black Americans. We examined these effects among White,
African American, Hispanic, and Asian MDs and by physician gender. Strength of
implicit bias exceeded self-report among all test takers except African
American MDs.
</blockquote>
I can agree that by 1997 there had been progress compared to the 1960s,
according to the data that Thernstrom mentioned, but the message she's
conveying is that much progress had already been made, which begs the
question, "Why are people still worked up about this?", which leads to a
dangerous complacence. But an important thing to recognize is how in 1997 we
can sit down and talk about these things, disagreement or not. Two decades
later, how far have we come as a country? Anne Applebaum
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/milley-critical-race-theory-marxism-racism-fox-news/619308/">wrote</a>
in The Atlantic the importance of openness to ideas, starting with a class I was
vividly alive to be physically in:
<blockquote>
Back in the 1980s, comparative-literature majors at my university had to take a
required course in literary theory. This course—Lit 130, if memory
serves—offered prospective scholars a series of frames and theories that could
be applied to the reading of books . . . We suffered through a lot of turgid
academic writing, but the class had its uses. I learned, among other things,
that one can read the same text from multiple points of view and therefore see
different themes in it. When a Marxist reads Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice,
for example, he might become interested in the way in which wealth, power, and
the determination to have both shapes the lives of all of the characters. When
a feminist reads the same book, she might discover that patriarchal attitudes
toward women, who are judged and valued for their marriageability, shape the
lives of the characters too. The Freudians, as you might surmise, would notice
a whole different set of motifs . . . In his congressional testimony last week,
General Mark Milley endorsed the underlying philosophy of Lit 130, which also
happens to be the underlying philosophy of a liberal education: Read widely;
listen to everybody; make your own judgment about what's important. Here is how
he put it: 'I do think it's important actually for those of us in uniform to be
open-minded and be widely read.' The phrase widely read means that you can and
should read things you disagree with. You can definitely read Marx without
becoming a Marxist. You can read critical race theory without becoming
a 'critical race theorist,' however you define that . . . You can also read
American history in this same spirit, the way you would read a great piece of
literature, seeking to understand the complexities and the nuances, the dark
and the light, the good and the bad. You can be inspired by the Declaration of
Independence, horrified by the expulsions of Native Americans, amazed by the
energy of immigrants and frontier settlers. You can understand that the United
States is a great and unique country whose values are worth defending—and
realize simultaneously that this same country has made terrible mistakes and
carried out horrific crimes. Is it so difficult to hold all of these disparate
ideas in your head at the same time?
</blockquote>
Applebaum then critiques those on both extremes, the rabid critical race
theorists who can't tolerate dissidents and the far right that refuses to deign
even a nod to critical race theory:
<blockquote>
Soldiers should know, Milley declared, that African Americans were counted as
less than fully human until 'we had a civil war and Emancipation Proclamation
to change it.' It took 'another 100 years,' he noted, to get to the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. All of that should sound completely uncontroversial. It's
just a recitation of facts about American history, things that most people
learn in elementary school. But to Fox News's Tucker Carlson, the mere
suggestion that you should seek to understand your own society, including its
flaws, makes you a 'pig' and 'stupid.' Laura Ingraham, another Fox News host,
called for defunding the military in response to Milley's statements, on the
grounds that 'he's chosen to indulge the radical whims of Democrats.' The
Carlsons, Ingrahams, and other culture warriors who now dominate the world of
conservative infotainment seem now to believe that the study of American
history—the knowledge of what actually happened on the territory that lies
between the two shining seas—should be forbidden. The Republican-controlled
state legislatures and school boards that are currently seeking to ban the
teaching of 'critical race theory' have this same intention . . . But there is
another kind of person who might dislike Milley's attitude. Critical race
theory is not the same thing as Marxism, but some of its more facile
popularizers share with Marxists the deep conviction that their way of seeing
the world is the only way worth seeing the world. Moreover, some have
encouraged people to behave as if this were the only way of seeing the world.
The structural racism that they have identified is real, just as the class
divisions once identified by the Marxists were real. But racism is not
everywhere, in every institution, or in every person's heart at all times. More
to the point, any analysis of American history or American society that sees
only structural racism will misunderstand the country, and badly. It will not
be able to explain why the U.S. did in fact have an Emancipation Proclamation,
a Civil Rights Act, a Black president. This is a major stumbling block, not so
much for the legal scholars (some of whom actually merit the title 'critical
race theorist') but rather for the popularizers and the
scholars-turned-activists who want to force everybody to recite the same
mantras.
</blockquote>
Listen to both sides! What a great idea that seems to come from common sense!

And what is the racialized experience like? Step back to 1992, when I, then -1
years old, frolicking in the ether and couldn't wait to materialize, about
thirty years before George Floyd's murder drew national attention, Jane
Elliott
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebPoSMULI5U">ran</a>
her brown eye/blue eye experiment, which reverses the direction of
discrimination, on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The video is half an hour long. If
you are white and are too uncomfortable to watch it to the end, how do you
suppose you can understand the many for whom this experience is America's
reality that the country has decided not to see? For people of color, they
would find in Jane the voice of grievance that working class whites have found
in Trump. Indeed, the experience of watching this video breaks through the
simple, naive, token emotions of one-dimensional happiness and joy of popular,
commercialized entertainment and touches briefly something of the heights of
literature, which is that humor and rage, truth and tragedy, mania and sanity,
life and its passing, are all one and the same.

When working class whites have been positioned at the front line to combat
others who have been historically oppressed, when neither group owns any
significant share of the country's wealth, is it not then obvious who is
fanning the flames? I don't think some mastermind is orchestrating some
conspiracy, but that those who live in everyday insecurity, when aggravated,
fall into a competition to get ahead of each other, and those who are more
privileged stand guard over their own possessions as they watch the chaos
unfold, laying out a narrative that even touching a fraction of the millions or
billions in their portfolios which they do not use stifles progress and
innovation or pushes the country towards socialism, when they clutch their
purses and think, "What business is it of mine to step in?"

Even with Trump out of office,
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/29/a-partisan-chasm-in-views-of-trumps-legacy/ft_21-03-24_trump_legacy_feelings_new1/">views</a>
on him have largely remained unchanged among Democrats and Republicans, and what
we will have in coming elections is more of the same contention, polarization,
and distrust across parties because the underlying issues of inequality remain,
susceptible to dirty marketing tactics by unscrupulous politicans more
interested in their lining their pockets than running a government. The trend,
however, is that younger generations are more liberal according to
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/030118_o_5/">this</a>

A
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/coming-generation-war/588670/">projection</a>
indicates that by 2039, Gen Z and Millenials will consist of nearly 70%
self-identifying Democrats. Given these trends, it may not be too off the mark
to claim: if the country manages to not descend into civil war, then politics
in the next decades, whoever the next Trumpist demagogue is in 2024 and
thereafter, will resemble the stock market, waves of short-term volatility as
distractions to the inevitable trajectory towards progress when the younger
generations, more open, more tolerant, more willing to fix problems and move
forward, constitute growing shares of the electorate.

Yet progress of this kind poses another problem to a healthy democracy when it
turns into a one-party monopoly. The victory at the top also comes with the
isolation of not having a sparring partner of equal standing. What will become
of the Republican Party? How will conservative populism evolve to confront the
problems of modernity when it can no longer appeal to a declining constituency
invigorated by toxic bravado, narrow-minded calls to a past era that is not
returning, smokescreening actual issues by yelling, "Look at those evil people
changing things!", instead of constructive solutions. How will the new platform
of the Republican party mitigate the dawn of a glamorous new serfdom at Apple
Park, Zuckerberg Park, and Bezos Park with equitable job growth, balance the
tax rate of less than
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">4%</a>
among the 25 richest Americans and a certain
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html">politician</a>
who has a history of avoiding taxes with HILLBILLY ELEGY, THE WORKING POOR, and
HARVEST OF SHAME, while also addressing climate change instead of thinking it a
hoax? How much is ExxonMobil paying you?

And what will happen to the Democratic Party once its principal opponent fades
into something of the past? Will its coalition that put itself together, each
group advancing its own interests by absorbing its neighbors', held into one by
intolerable, toxic fumes coming out of the other side's pulpit, break into
foolish fragments as predictable as human nature, white women prioritizing
white women, Blacks voting for Blacks, Asians for Asians, Hispanics for
Hispanics, and white men, caught between race and gender, choose race and side
with white women? The results from last week's NYC Democratic mayoral primary
suggest just this kind of racial delineation. Putting the candidates' proposed
policies aside, a neighborhood's voter preference strongly resembles its racial
composition. The Times released an interactive district-level
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/23/nyregion/nyc-mayor-primary-results-precinct-map.html">map</a>
of how the city voted, which can be compared with a map of the city's racial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City#/media/File:Race_and_ethnicity_2010-_New_York_City_(5559914315).png">distribution</a>.
Manhattan's core, predominantly white, voted for Kathryn Garcia. The Asian
neighborhoods, and oddly also the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Borough Park,
voted for Andrew Yang. And Harlem, the Bronx, and large swaths of Queens and
Brooklyn, in the Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, voted for Eric Adams or Maya
Wiley. I don't think these results are a coincidence, and if this is a
precursor to what will happen to the Democratic Party, then perhaps all one can
do is shrug in disappointment. If you say race is not a problem and you are
white, let me know again when I point out that the
<a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/children-are-at-the-forefront-of-u-s-racial-and-ethnic-change/">minorities</a>
of today will soon no longer be minorities and that Christianity, even
considered as the sum of its denominations, may very well not be the
predominant
<a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/">religion</a>
for much longer. This is the inconvenient problem of race, not as discriminatory
racism which also needs to be addressed, but as the country's identity shift.
Perhaps fortunately, this is a problem of time, and the free solution is the
passing of the decades, when the younger generations have already been slowly
acclimating to the changing face of America which in a gradual shift will not
seem out of the ordinary, like eyes seeing their reflection every morning but
don't notice the wrinkles accumulating on the face. If you say race is not a
problem and you are not white, consider what will happen when white Hispanics
start voting like whites, Blacks push for expanding affirmative action, Asians
insist on maintaining policing. What will become of race then? Time will tell,
but perhaps it'll only be a problem when people remain walled up in
self-interested isolation, but why not be spurred by the idea of trying
something new? Why not? How many in the American heartland still conceive of
New York as just the one in the past as sung by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrUfJW1JGk">Sinatra</a>
without also realizing there's also the modern ones by

and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHKXYWZYH5E">Alicia Keys</a>?

Back to the present. I'll end this section on politics with
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/">comments</a>
of how each party feels about the other. It reads like a dysfunctional
relationship. Their words, not mine, but the Republican views I disagree with
are the ones that have no easy compromise and ones I don't think are promising
to address because they existed even before the current hysterical
polarization, distrust, cancel culture, and utter lack of communication between
parties, and which are not the cause of the country's intolerance towards the
other side but which only seem exacerbated because of growing economic
imbalance, when one side is naively scapegoating in a rapidly changing
demographic and the other stings with unaddressed racial and gender
inequalities. These issues are: abortion, gun rights, implementing religion
values in the law, and whether the Constitution should be adapted to the modern
country and not remain catered to the one two hundred years ago. I'll also take
the liberty to add that two hundred years ago was when people weren't able to
buy assault rifles, when slavery was legal and the original text
proclaimed, "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
several States which may be included within this Union, according to their
respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of
free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and
excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons"—until one
century later when an amendment repealed such nonsense.

Twenty years ago, the Korean singer Lee Jung-hyun introduced techo music to her
country's music industry. In Lee Jung-hyun's song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stiFBReCjrs">WA</a>,
the brief spans of Eastern instrumentation evoke the sudden recollection of a
culture's past millenium before descending into spasmodic flailing that
violently inverts it, and then she starts singing into a microphone attached to
her pinkie. The performance is not as outlandish as Klaus Nomi but brings to
mind the absurd humor of LADY SNOWBLOOD, an absolutely ridiculous cult classic
whose eponymous lady, in her quest for vengeance, repeatedly fells squadrons of
armed men who back away from her every step, just one woman in a kimono walking
forward, who also sings her own theme song. The performance's aesthetic has no
meaning in the West, especially not in contemporary American pop music, where
excess is the norm, and flamboyant, ostentatious, garish images are merely
run-of-the-mill, and something far more provocative is never far away, an
unfortunate state of the industry in which little is left to the imagination or
contemplation and in which the outrageous can be met with perfunctory, unfazed
nonchalance. It does, however, stand out in the East, in a conservative culture
that mandates conformity and convention, in which anomaly does not have general
appeal without official sanction. Contrast Lee Jung-hyun's song with the
typical sulker, this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDywqSyQ3Mc">one</a>
in Cantonese, which is too prim, too proper, the colossal weight of the East's
ancient civilization bearing down on any born under its early-rising sun, too
sweet and cute and tame and sanitized, utterly without an independent voice
that contributes something to society that the culture would not otherwise have
had. Or saccharine excess taken over the top, losing most of its reserve and
inhibition in this Korean
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ">one</a>
that has the misfortune of being in a replaceable band in a music industry
that's productionized its pop star supply chain and learned to profit from the
fickle, the vogue, and the trendy passing fads in modern consumerism, but
perhaps I shouldn't be complaining if it boosts Asian representation and alters
the Pavlovian conditioning away from old stereotypes in mass culture, even if
it becomes a continuous stream of robotic, soulless Candy Crush. Every band has
its heyday, but I suppose we each have for us our own terminal time and place
whose only mystery is as difficult as filling in two variables. I'm not privy
to the details of Lee Jung-hyun's work but I wouldn't be surprised if she was
the one who envisioned the concept, convinced the producers on its viability,
wrote the lyrics, choreographed the dance, and went onto the stage doing her
thing, all 5'2" of her.

Needless to say, this sort of thing is possible only in the imprudent craze of
youth, and Lee Jung-hyun was 19 when she came up with the song; now in her 40s,
she has settled into staid comfort, having already done what she needed to do.
Why is it that our best moments are gone in a flash? Our collective fate is
expressed in the melancholic resignation of an Ozu or the inescapable
transience of a Naruse, and we can merely hold on to snapshots of a specific
space and its people in a bygone memory, flipping through a photo album to find
our identity: the rugged American individual in the Wild West in John Ford's
THE SEARCHERS and its landscape in Terrence Malick's BADLANDS, Patrick
Modiano's persistent and haunting German-occupied France, the intellectual
sphere and Jewish paranoia in Woody Allen's MANHATTAN. Or one from among the
evolution of Jia Zhangke who has taken it upon himself and cinema to chart the
experience of China's decades post-reform via his characters and, through
them, the zeitgeist of an entire generation hurtled, with all its angst,
longings, and emptiness, into modernity. Often, flames that shine the brightest
do not shine for long, and just as electrons jumping to higher orbitals soon
collapse back, so, too, David Foster Wallace emitted his contribution to
humanity in INFINITE JEST and then, while working on his next novel, about the
mundanity of human life viewed through employees at the IRS, took his own life
at 46. But, at least in my book, better a scintillating 40 years than 80 slowly
bled dry.

The film THE HOURS properly captures the writer's tortured inflection in Nicole
Kidman's wonderful portrayal of Virginia Woolf: private exasperation, breaths of
pain, conscious agony. She narrates at the end: "To look life in the face.
Always, to look life in the face, and to know it for what it is. At last, to
know it, to love it, for what it is." In her eyes is the sensation of bare feet
walking on broken glass, nails dragged across the blackboard, claustrophobia
under the skin, all silently suffocating as hushed secrets are heard from
another room's walls. Such too is the texture of Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS.
Any authenticity does not involve dilution by someone else's presence. George
Steiner said: "If you can phrase what to you makes life worth living, the
absolute center, it's a lie because it's nobody else's business. It's a
self-deception. I think it probably lies lower than speech or on the other side
of speech for many human beings. It is not articulable. It is certainly not
publicly communicable . . . What makes life worth living is so private a thing,
so intimate a thing, that articulacy conveys the constant danger of a rhetoric
of self-delusion, of exhibitionism. We are in a society of unparalleled
exhibitionism at every level." As Laozi's proverb goes, "He who knows does
not speak. He who speaks does not know."

The conventional story that has won the world over, with its excitement,
adventure, passion, is just one formula. Create a character. Name him or her X1.
Create a sidekick. Call him or her X2. Create a mentor. Name him or her Y. Set
it in a place and a time. Call it Z. Create a problem. Call it P. Fill in the
variables with whatever—what a bore. How refreshing it is, then, to know that
there is a joy in watching films touched by surrealism like David Lynch's
ERASERHEAD and MULHOLLAND DRIVE, or Seijun Suzuki's BRANDED TO KILL, or
Bergman's PERSONA, which also embodies the sheer delight of pure cinema. To
watch the edges of reality lapse is to feel again something of that unknowable
mystery of first consciousness, before it all becomes as predictable as
conversations already had, friends already made and gone, careers already
climbed, all dull and dry until we can taste the distilled mana that once
was—the singularity, the absurd, the sublime, that phase shift when wakefulness
fades into sleep every night and then one last time—to sail towards the black
hole and with the might of human hands wrest from it the makings of its innards.

Is not the only response to the fact of our eventual collective annihilation,
when fully understood and embraced not as some abstract notion restrained to
some distant future but as fate that can arrive even tonight, to resort to
humor and the realization that this journey is nothing more than: life
as illusion, life as a dream. Did Nietzsche not touch on this when he wrote,
"Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster . . .
for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you." The
consequence of his eternal recurrence is that everything anyone can ever do or
say or think has already been done, said, and thought. If life is understood as
merely motions and physicality, then we are all just playing with legos. Time is
space is space is time—we are at present, all at once, not yet born and living
and dead. Beckett wrote: "Have you not done tormenting me with your accursed
time! It's abominable! When! When! One day, is that not enough for you, one day
he went dumb, one day I went blind, one day we'll go deaf, one day we were born
and one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that not enough for
you? They give birth astride a grave, the light gleams an instant, then its
night once more."

Paolo Sorrentino's film THE GREAT BEAUTY ends in an eloquent reflection of what
we are, set to John Tavener's choral rendition of his countryman William Blake's
poem THE LAMB. The scene, narrated by the main character in a brief monologue,
watches an aged nun whose purity in life has made her near sainthood as she
reaches the top of the steps of a cathedral, choosing to pull herself up by
hands and knees, the camera in front of her zooming towards her face as she
finishes the ascent, bowing down to kiss her necklace, the holy cross, as it
comes to a rest on the floor of the landing. While we watch this moment with its
music surging towards the finality of tranquil divinity, the main character
summarizes us. He, conscious of modern Italy's culture of decadence in contrast
to the country's long history of beauty and triumph, its marble statuary
forgotten in basements as its youth dance the night away, observes the decaying
culture while immersing in it himself, who for many decades was unable to break
free. In the ending scene, in his native Italian, his voice joins the choir as
we watch ourselves in the nun: "This is how it always ends. With death. But
first there was life, hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It is all
settled beneath the chitter, the chatter, and the noise: silence and sentiment,
emotion and fear. The haggard, inconstant flashes of beauty, and then the
wretched squalor and miserable humanity, all buried under the cover of the
embarrassment of being in the world: blah, blah, blah, blah." The film closes as
the narrator at that moment realizes something and embraces the absurd, deciding
to begin his novel. He is standing on a cliff by the ocean, facing the love of
his youth, a woman on whom the film rests its last shot.

Rilke wrote, "Loving does not at first mean merging, surrendering, and uniting
with another person (for what would a union be of two people who are
unclarified, unfinished, and still incoherent?), it is a high inducement for
the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to become world, to
become world in himself for the sake of another person; it is a great,
demanding claim on him, something that chooses him and calls him to vast
distances . . . But this is what young people are so often and so disastrously
wrong in doing: they(who by their very nature are impatient) fling themselves
at each other when love takes hold of them, they scatter themselves, just as
they are, in all their messiness, disorder, bewilderment." But even Rilke,
champion of man as individual, believed in the possibility of love: "love that
consists in this: that two solitudes protect and border and greet each other."
The film director Wong Kar Wai meditates on this feeling of distance; his
signature is unmistakable. In spite of every element in the film running at the
full speed of life, his characters seem stuck in the eye of the tornado.
Although the camera is pushed so close to the actor that the face takes up half
the screen, although sugary pop music plays that evokes the high ebullience of
the teenage years, although we enter the character's head and hear the thoughts
as voice-overs spoken as if to a friend, although the film is so rich in
vibrant color, the shots so alive with active energy, although the film is so
flush with life, although we are brought so physically close that we can touch
their breath, this palpable fact remains: all his characters feel so far
away. Whether his film is set in his home city's modern metropolis, in a
foreign country where he does not speak the language, in a technocratic future,
or in a dystopian fantasy, Wong Kar Wai has been making just one film: the
longing for romance and the impossibility of intimacy, and all we can have is
timeless jazz, strobing lights, the rain outside, and moody puffs of smoke
rising from our cigarette. Wong Kar Wai's preoccupation with love tempts the
important question: what does it mean to be alive? This is a question Abbas
Kiarostami poses from another angle: should we bother to live? Abbas
Kiarostami's TASTE OF CHERRY takes as its style a stark austerity in which the
camera sits in the passenger seat watching a man drive about the desert,
looking for someone to bury him. The weight of the film is implicit, not in the
overt, unignorable manner of Francis Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW in which the
depths of consciousness is splayed in overbearing sweat and grime, or in
Tarkovsky's STALKER which forces upon us the texture of time and the dread of
liquid consciousness. How to capture life in film? Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD
is wonderful in concept but failed to deliver the punch. It followed its actors
over 13 years as they moved through life's stages, but the film's delivery
lacks the wonder and elevation of universality, its scenes reading as a series
of facts so proud of its idea that it hasn't bothered to put itself together
into a vision, the film's primary fault being that the director was not strong
enough. At the other end, Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE attempted to encompass
so much of life it loses itself in airy voice-overs in an unfocused daydream
that overwhelms but leads nowhere. If the point is to watch one family
interspersed with spectacularly shot moments of the sun, eclipses, and the
skies above, why not just settle with Ron Fricke's BARAKA and lose oneself in
the drawn-out documentary of the many human cultures across the world and be
drowned in detail?

We witnessed in John Conway's GAME OF LIFE that from simplicity dawns
complexity, that the workings of seeming causation and sentient life can come
on a board of pixels from all of three rules:

Birth: A dead cell with three live neighbors comes to life. <br>
Prolong: A live cell with two or three neighbors remains alive. <br>
Death: A live cell with zero or one neighbors dies of underpopulation; a
live cell with four or more neighbors dies of overcrowding.

From these three rules came life-forms, among them spaceships, gliders, clocks,
frogs, flip-flops, and beehives, and from these three rules have sprung what
have come to resemble civilization in the pixel. While the message from
simplicity is clear, Conway, a mathematician, made the mathematician's mistake
in thinking that actual life is so simple. Perhaps a modification to the death
rule should be made: a cell lasts the span of eighty breaths, but even this
doesn't convey the circumstance of the human condition in being aware of its
eventual demise. What are the set of rules enabling us? Are we merely hamsters
running on a wheel? Is consciousness real and not preordained as a set of
inevitable chemical reactions? Is reality in fact real? Cao Xueqin wrote in
DREAM OF THE RED CHAMBER: "Truth becomes fiction when the fiction's true. Real
becomes unreal when the unreal's real."

<h4>2021-04-04, 日. On Religion and Roger Scruton.</h4>
I'm an atheist, and today's post situates my views in the context of religion,
and why the religion question largely doesn't matter.

First, I will state some of my doubts. To even begin to convince me to believe
in God, you must answer this question of mine: why Jesus or Yahweh or Allah when
I can also choose Zeus and Hera, Shiva and Brahma, Isis and Osiris, Odin and
Ymir, Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl, Ababinili and Agu'gux, Hadad and Anu?
Why one god and not four hundred? Would God have been the next titular character
had Joseph Campbell extended his HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES? I can't shake off
the observation that those who are religious are religious because of a sense of
community and not because they are wholly convinced from first principles in the
existence of God. To convince me to be religious is to show me that faith is not
just the happenstance religion of the society into which we are born, assigned
at birth and immured as the sole option when we are too young to resist our
parents and our friends, too young to think and doubt, too young to realize that
by adulthood we will be too accustomed to holding on to faith out of nominal
identification with that community and not out of true belief.

I'm not speaking of religion in the way Alan Watts did when he used a marketing
ploy to slip God under the cover of mesmerizing rhetoric. The God he spoke of
was not the omnipotent deity of the Judeo-Christian tradition but a god
embedded in the personal and everyday, everywhere and needing no more worship
than a spiritual awareness. What a great cheat! How he committed the
intellectual laziness of conflating one god with another by using the same
terminology! The notion of God is too loosely defined. Do we agree with
Maimonides when he explained that the Jewish God is such a perfect unity that
he could not be described in any positive sense, and we cannot say God has arms
or legs, or that God is omnipotent, or that God has thoughts, for any such
statement limits the greatness of God? Surely one can follow this description
as one can follow a thought experiment, but no one can persuade me away from my
immediate thought: what a wonderful fiction!—though such a character is
certainly too dull for my book.

To live motivated by the thought that disorderly conduct towards your fellow men
earns you a one-way ticket to eternal condemnation seems to me immensely
self-centered because such a guiding principle suggests we have an eye towards
our own fates when we choose how to behave  towards others, and that propriety
is not a self-evident principle derivable from common sense and reason. How low
does this suggest of us and our fellow men that we can't be decent without fear
of punishment? Bertrand Russell wrote, "Religion, since it has its source in
terror, has dignified certain kinds of fear, and made people think them not
disgraceful. In this it has done mankind a great disservice: all fear is bad. I
believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive. I am
not young, and I love life. But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the
thought of annihilation. Happiness is none the less true happiness because it
must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value because they are
not everlasting. Many a man has borne himself proudly on the scaffold; surely
the same pride should teach us to think truly about a man's place in the world.
Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver after the cosy
indoor warmth of traditional humanising myths, in the end the fresh air brings
out vigour, and the great spaces have a splendour of their own." One can enter
the sublime by sitting in church in the front pew, enjoying Bach's music playing
under the towering apse just as one can enter it by lying back on the open
grass, under the constellations of the night sky, all on one's own,
contemplating  the stars whence one came; one can be spiritual without a god.
Humanity's pursuits—reaching for transcendence, enjoying music, living
virtuously, seeking meaning and purpose—what does God have to do with them?
Everything we've done, we've done without Him.

The most compelling argument for believing in God I've come across is Roger
Scruton's. Scruton did not dodge the hard questions, did not consider his views
an obvious truth, was not intolerant to conflicting views, and was not so
deluded in his own beliefs that he couldn't accommodate cross-examination.
During an interview he was asked, "God. We got rid of Him, finally. We finally
recognized we are totally alone in the universe. Oceans of time before us,
oceans of time after us—Schopenhauer—yeah? And amidst we are, giving meaning to
our lives, just one little second in eternity. And now you're coming up with God
again. In three or four minutes you're talking about a <i>moral</i> God." The
interviewer continued: "If we see our presence in the universe at this very
moment in time for 60 or 70 or 80 years as one whisper, and we can't give
meaning to our own lives because there are no preconditions, there is no God,
there is no moral statement in the universe itself, of the universe itself.
Isn't that more challenging than returning to the old idea of a moral God?"
Taken aback for a second from so direct a question, Scruton replied: "If you
want to live your live being challenged, that's fine. There are lots of things
more challenging than my worldview, but it doesn't follow they're for that
reason more true. It's possible for someone like Rilke to live with a kind of
death of God feeling, to say to himself, 'For God has been taken from the world,
along with so much else. I will now remake everything according to my own inner
light and find consolation there.' And to some extent, that's what I do, but not
everybody is Rilke. Most people, deprived of this kind of consolation, don't
rise to the challenge at all. They sink a long way beneath it, and they live
without that aspiration to be something better that they would otherwise have
had. And so I'm very much opposed to taking this sort of thing away from people.
If you lose it yourself, then of course that could be regarded as a misfortune,
or you might regard it a great liberation, as Nietzsche tried to do. But that's
your problem. You deal with it. I have my own way of dealing with it, and I
think I have dealt with it. I worked my way back to something, not really the
God of organized religion, but I worked my way back to something like a God
idea. I'm giving it a place in my life which enables me to stand to some extent
in judgment of myself, as I think I should." Fair enough. This answer satisfies
me, and I can respect Scruton for it. The necessary consequence, of course, is
that Scruton thinks we were both created in the image of God and that I have
fallen from favor, while I think his belief in an unprovable deity ludicrous. No
further word can be said that can change our minds, but this doesn't matter
because the thwarted conversation is postponed until the infinitude that comes
after the day when both of us are dead, when, as far as we're concerned,
everything ceases to matter. I may not agree with Scruton's views, but I can
respect him for adequately examining his convictions and living by them to the
very end.

I am not Richard Dawkins. I don't impose atheism on anyone. Freedom of religion
is one of the founding principles of the country. If you are religious, be
satsfied in your community, and I mine, which proclaims: We have no god to love,
and no god loves us, we do not believe in deities whose business it is to lord
over our miniscule lives, for we believe not in gods but in humanity. I can find
the religiously devout among those I consider at the pinnacle of humanity:
Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, William Blake, just as I can find among
them atheists. My gripe is not against religion itself but the lack of the
necessary search and labor to convince oneself beyond, "It's what everyone
around me believes, and we fear those who don't."

In America, we have a party that knows it is losing power and instead of a
graceful handover and adapting to the times, it resorts to pathetic measures
like gerrymandering and restricting the voting rights of Americans who are not
on their side, the whole party patently struggling to hold on to dear life. I
can respect Scruton, but I can't respect the whole line of Republican senators
who ride on disinformation, sending the wrong message to working class Americans
to vote against their interests so the rich can have lower taxes, those
Republicans who sell religious and national purity like Mitch McConnell—whose
wife happens to be Chinese and who is responsible for his wealth—and Ted Cruz,
and their predecessor William Buckley who would have rather resorted to lies
and elitism rather than accept progress. Why all the opposition to change?
Martin Luther posting his NINETY-FIVE THESES on a church's door sounds pretty
radical. A group of 102 religious pilgrims seeking religious freedom sailing on
the Mayflower to a new, largely unknown continent sounds pretty radical. The
French Revolution sounds pretty radical. This is the pattern of human
civilization: today's radical is tomorrow's past, as certain and unyieldable as
the iron law of history. As Schopenhauer put it, "All truth passes through three
stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is
accepted as being self-evident." For the logical among us, think of it this way:
jump forward on the timeline and look back; today's radicalism is already in the
past. This is not to say all change is progress. Marxism, Nazism, Communism,
Fascism, anarchy, populism, nuclear fallout, and nativism are not avenues of
progress. Progress is determined by what works as a push forward for humanity,
not by self-interest, power-mongering, greed, and blinkered nationalism.

The remainder of this post discusses Scruton. In considering my differences
against Scruton, I can't help but also notice the immense similarities, and I
recall Schopenhauer's  world as illusion, world as appearance, reality as but a
surface veneer. Schopenhauer took this idea from the ancient Vedic tradition,
which also had so inspired Hesse that one of his recurring projects was an
attempt to reconcile the West's dilemma between rationality and the animal
within against India's amorphous nature of reality. Peel away our differences—he
a conservative and I a liberal, his Christianity and my atheism, his British
reserve, stiff upper lip, preoccupation with dignity,  ever aspiring to serenity
and order, and my fearless charge towards intensity, passion, flame, grabbing
life by the horns, he who returns ever again to equilibrium when I say, "Why
bother resting? After this brief stint, we have all eternity for
equilibrium"—and there is more  in Scruton that I can respect not only because
of his unmitigated journey towards authenticity, but because the underlying
ideas guiding the way he lived his life are also mine.

Scruton defended Heidegger's notion of dwelling as "this attempt to reaffirm
with your connection with a particular place at a particular time and a
particular social web . . . Every serious idea is dangerous. In a civilized mind
it is not. It is an instrument of peace. I'm talking about peaceful existence in
a single place, an unthreatening form of being"—Scruton not only agrees with
this as an intellectual idea but lived by it. Scruton expands on this idea with
Hegel's homecoming spirit: "In all of us there is a desire for homecoming, where
we find ourselves having ventured out into all these dangerous experiments of
individual living, at last coming back, swallowing all our pride, and humbly
acquiesing in a social order which is bigger than ourselves." In these words
Scruton also captured the trajectory of his life, as he recounted his early
years: "I was very fortunate in having an unhappy childhood so that my desire
from the very beginning was to escape from it . . . I was very much aware of the
difference between me and everybody else, that there was something in me that
needed to be addressed. I had a question in my life. I didn't know what the
question was, but I knew that it needed an answer, and I had first to identify
what the question was. So the things that my contemporaries took pleasure in,
like football, cinema, whatever it might be, pop music, had very little
significance for me, even though like all my contemporaries of course I played
the guitar, a bit of bass guitar, and all the usual—things one had to do. But
even while doing it I regarded myself just as ridiculous as the people around
me." It was only later that Scruton gradually came upon how to pose the
question: "Someone like Heidegger would say it was the question of Being. What
and why am I? What is this soul doing in this environment, and how can  it
possibly come to be in that environment in a way that will bring peace to
itself?" In middle age, Scruton described his fear of choosing to abandon his
position as a professor as "being afraid to give up a career that I thought to
be certain and secure, but I knew that I should give it up because it was not
me, my career as a teacher. I finally got the courage to give it up, but I left
it very late." And in describing the broader fear of living, Scruton said, "When
you're confronted with this sort of fear, you might run from it into false
consolations, things which are not real consolations because they involve no
overcoming . . . I can see what it would be to take refuge in wine completely,
and allow that to soothe one through one's day and to soothe one through one's
inadequacies, to enable one to put this fear to one side.  That is not a
consolation. A consolation to me comes from having confronted trouble, and
eliciting from the heart of the trouble the resolution of it." Scruton examines
himself in the way of someone who has the habit of doing deep reflection: "I
have always worked very hard at my literary gifts, but in every direction
they've suggested, philosophical essays, fiction, anything that seems to come to
my pen, but it's always been enormous work, and I've always connected it
deliberately with my subjectivity, the peculiar confusion which I inherited by
being born the thing that I was. And I made them slaves, my literary works, of
my need, and each of them had the task of unraveling this confusion . . . except
for a few academic articles, all this has been a completely personal voyage of
discovery . . . so this was a very personal thing, which had nothing to do with
the normal <i>Bildung</i> of a normal academic philosopher. My life was a kind
of <i>Bildungsroman</i> in which the academic part was a sort of continuous and
enjoyable mistake. I shouldn't have been a teacher, or I shouldn't have been
locked away in libraries. My heart and soul have always been in other things,
I've always been involved in other things, which have always been more important
to feeding what I really think."

Scruton's first marriage failed, but his second marriage, at 52, to Sophie
Jeffreys, after a "slow, quiet, respectful courtship," not in the searing
passion of uninhibited romance but in the quaint charm, quiet serenity,
coquettish allure, and mutual attraction hidden beneath preserved dignity so apt
to the British manner, lasted until his death. Scruton composed a piece for the
piano dedicated to his wife "which would convey something of her composure and
orderliness." He called it BOREAS BLOWS NOT, referencing Herodotus: "Boreas
blows not through the young virgin who lives alone in the house with her mother.
Because at the time, Sophie was living alone in her house with her mother. So it
was a description of Boreas the north wind refusing to blow, or unable to blow,
through this secure little cottage." Scruton made for himself and his wife a
version of this little cottage, with a yard in the front for the horses he kept
for fox-hunting. In his cottage in the countryside of Wiltshire, on a plot of
land he bought that he named Scrutopia, Scruton lived out his years with his
wife among books lining the walls and a grand piano in the center of the living
room. True to his word, Scruton dwelled, playing Bach in his village's church
every Sunday. Scruton dwelled, returning to the countryside into which he was
born: "My childhood was in a semi-detached house by a railway line in which we
were, you know, very poor, very much living in the old class resentment of the
English . . . It has nothing to do with this. This here is created by books and
music in the middle of a countryside which I love and among people doing
innocent old-fashioned things with animals. That's as far as one can get." In
Wiltshire, Scruton lived until his death in January 2020. May he rest in the
peace of eternity that I too will one day join, hopefully having attained the
same peace in human terms.

<h4>2021-03-26, 五.</h4>
The great pessimist Emil Cioran once wrote, "Nothingness may well have been more
convenient. How difficult it is to dissolve oneself in Being!" With that, he
ended his essay, THE TEMPTATION TO EXIST. It is a revelation to read Cioran, who
also wrote books whose titles convey his essence such as ON THE HEIGHTS OF
DESPAIR and THE TROUBLE WITH BEING BORN, not to convert to nihilism, but to bear
witness to the pits of the philosophical abyss of life taken to the extreme so
that one no longer fears facing the dark unknown, for one has already seen it
and knows it and can say, "Ah, is that all?" I'm not a nihilist, but I do think
it is crucial to conceive the various avenues others have taken to grasp upwards
towards meaning, perhaps especially so when it fails, perhaps because we will
also recognize bits of nihilism in ourselves. Of course, the intellectual
resolution to nihilism is simple: life should have meaning, even though it
doesn't and the meaning itself is meaningless; what's the alternative? But what
is such a meaning worth pursuing in spite of its emptiness known from the
outset?  What makes a life not just a toy put together on an assembly line,
robot arms scheduled to add parts as the toy moves through its decades and
phases, the script and social constructs mandating the school years, the working
years, a family, retirement, and finally its end  when the toy is completed,
fully fabricated to specification as it is dropped off with its glorious
splendor in the dumpster with every other toy that has come before and will come
after, the toy smiling that it's been carried along the mechanization's selfsame
routine as it croaks its last breath, smiling the whole way because that's what
the toy has imagined to be its purpose. What makes a life worthy? The fact is we
all die one day. How hilarious! How lovely! But how disappointingly human. This
is the game we're playing, the time remaining on our turn ticking away, and when
it all ends it will have been oh so meaningless. It is better to address the
fundamental questions of life than to duck the head into the sand, ignoring the
necessity of truth, and blasting music at full volume in a buoyed state of
walking denial. How many times I've mused the question of life in a
conversation, to be redirected to a sudden distraction cropped up in avoidance.
Or a long book that spins itself in circles of words, occasionally reaching for
the famous name in an effort in vain, so bedazzled by its own verbosity that I
can't help but notice that the author may be more lost than me, so bloated in
conceit that he may no longer realize he's driven himself into irrelevance. But:
you're not answering my question. It's my most important one. I'll give you all
my time. Tell me something about life I don't already know.

<h4>2021-03-20, 六. On Asian America's Awakening.</h4>
This post is long overdue and comes in response to this week's shooting of six
Asians in Atlanta and to the broader issue of rising anti-Asian hate since the
start of the pandemic. Let's disabuse ourselves of the notion that racism is
some unprehensile abstraction in which we Asian Americans are not victims. This
very idea breeds illusions that, naively, it is largely a bygone evil, or,
falsely, that it doesn't exist, or, immaturely, that someone else will take care
of it. There's no reason to take it personally because these the symptoms of
racism are the same everywhere and are just as transferable to the next person.
They're not willy-nilly, wishy-washy, but persistent, predictable, unvarying,
systematic.

<b>Degrees of racism</b><br>
Unconscious bias<br>
Conscious convictions<br>
Online bigotry<br>
Microaggressions<br>
Institutional discrimination<br>
Passing comments<br>
Verbal aggression<br>
Physical assault<br>
Murder and genocide

These symptoms come on top of a backdrop of media's unilateral caricature and
stereotype since the 1800's when Asians first arrived to the country, none of
which is helped by our small population that leads to scant exposure in the
public consciousness. Like most things in life, these symptoms are sifted
through the unignorable influence of class and play out differently depending on
the stratum of the perpetrator. The struggling do not refrain from taking
more extreme measures and the privileged express themselves in subtler forms,
especially when they don't need to do it themselves.

I'm going to preface the rest of this post by saying that there are genuinely
decent folks whose only fault is simply that they have not been exposed to
multiculturalism and diversity and so don't have anything to form an opinion of
other races other than prejudiced and outdated textbooks from school and
exaggerated, distorted stereotypes gone unchecked. It is not them that I have
in mind but those blockheads like some 21-year-old who, guilty over his sex
addiction, turned his gun on someone else rather than the more obvious solution
of turning it on himself. Or those inhuman cretins who would run in full speed
up to a 91-year-old to push him to the ground. Or those blatant aggressors who
in spite of ample anti-racist messaging from government, news outlets, and
social media, in spite of common sense, in spite of any propriety or civility,
continue to lash out in blind hate. Or closeted bigots who so fear justice that
they keep their hysterical xenophobia to themselves, whatever their walk of
life.

I am not surprised whatsoever that Asians are being targeted. I can't help but
exclaim: how banal and boring! Tell me something new! As soon as the news broke
of COVID's origins last year I immediately anticipated such a development.
There is not the slightest indication in the racial history of this country
that suggests otherwise. On the contrary I would be surprised if this shooting
were the last. Count on it: discrimination and patent racism will continue once
life returns to normal and people resume congregating in person, in forms
subtle and explicit, verbal and behavioral, in school admissions, in job
applications, in fewer appointments for doctor and lawyers, in everyday
encounters. We do not have it worst; Blacks have had a far longer and bloodier
march against racism. We Asians have piggy-backed on the civil rights movement
and benefited from monumental progress towards true equality in the 1960s
without bearing the brunt of the melee. What makes us think we can surmount
racial boundaries if Blacks still have not? However, our problem is more akin
to the Jewish one: a small successful minority that—who knows?—might be
wealthier and more educated than our assaulters. And yet we do not have power,
we do not have bite—why? I can't be wrong in saying a large part of the reason
is that Asian culture obeys authority and doesn't stir trouble, overwhelmingly
preferring comfort and stability over due process and justice. Perhaps a
generation or two later, the offspring of this period's doctors, academics, and
engineers, comfortable enough in their social reproduction, will have the
chutzpah to take up the risk of fighting back.

Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, a Korean artist and writer, was raped and murdered in the
Puck Building in New York in 1982 and received no more news coverage than one
obituary in The Village Voice. When an Asian dies, the subtext is she was the
stereotypical passive victim, quickly banished to the side, the details of the
crime reduced to mere facts, leaving out any semblance of a relatable person.
Her friend Sandy Flickerman-Lewis recounts, "People only say that she died
young. The never indicate the horror." She says later, "Theresa was not passive.
She fought back." And why did Theresa receive such little coverage?
Flickerman-Lewis says, "She was just another Asian woman. If she were a young
white artist from the Upper West Side, it would have been all over the news."
If she were white, all over the news indeed! Seven years later in the same city,
Trisha Meili, who worked in corporate finance—but let me add the important
detail—she's white—was raped in Central Park, and what a public outcry! What
investigations, what litigations, what media coverage that even two decades
afterwards people were still talking about it! Here's the reason: someone white
is one of "us".  When asked to talk about Theresa's death, curators and scholars
reply with such numbing politeness that they come across not as complicit but
innocent: "We have always tried to focus on Cha's amazing work and not to
sensationalize her story", and refraining from mentioning her death "out of
respect for her famly, not to overshadow the work." Of course not. Asians are
one-dimensional tokens who, as artists, are only artists known through their
work and not actual humans who have lives outside their role. The record is not
any better served by the fact that Theresa died and Trisha did not, and she went
on to publish her memoir so that we the American public can relate to all the
minutiae of her lovingly concretized life.

An Asian get murdered and no one cares. And still we appeal to someone else! How
can we not laugh at ourselves! These are any number of the scenarios we may very
well find ourselves in: someone with a rifle walks into a store and starts
firing, someone sidles up behind you with a kitchen knife, or you're walking and
a car that passes by suddenly stops behind you and someone jumps out, charging
at you with an axe. Where are our surgeons and professors then? History repeats
itelf: the news flashes the breaking headlines, people signal the fashionable
politics, and it is erased all too soon, we forgotten under a quiet headstone as
the rest of the country returns to its unhassled business—let's pay lip service,
mope for two seconds, and continue about our ordinary day!—who cares about some
Asian? To my fellow Asians who remain meek from the ancestral culture,
unaccustomed to the reality, I have nothing to say but this: stop running and
hiding. Your children will not thank you for leaving the world the way it was
given to you. When someone throws rocks through your house's windows, when a man
forces himself through your doors, when a random kid runs up and pushes you to
the ground, when someone opens fire on your family, you stand and reply in kind
with the full force of rectified self-defense. We cannot remain handcuffed to
bookish intellentsia but must pick up the proper tools for the challenge.
Science communicates by theory and evidence. Writers communicate the human
experience across time and age—the best ones tend to be dead. Painters
communicate in exhibitions. Investors communicate with supply and demand.
Entrepreneurs communicate with their products. And violence so singularly
directed out of blind hatred demands its proper reply, in the only language that
brutes understand. Korean cardiologist, how ludicrous you are to inform your
assaulter you're Korean and not Chinese. Let me help you realize: he, like most
white Americans, doesn't care. If our response to this surge of pandemic racism
is simply overcoming personal inhibitions and deigning to share our encounters
with racist incidents, then the inevitable outcome is this: next month people
will forget because they simply can't be bothered. Has racism gone away for our
Black brothers and sisters who have been calling out racism in person, in
politics, in film, in literature, online, in the history books for so much
longer? Are you sure people care whether you're a Vietnamese refugee or a Korean
lawyer, a Japanese corporate expatriate or a Chinese software engineer? How do
you talk reason to someone who pulls a gun on you? Are you serious when you try
to teach empathy to a vandal in a mad frenzy to set your house on fire? Cry all
you wish on TV, write as many articles asking people to share their stories, do
your best to raise awareness, but nothing in the country's history points to any
help other than from yourself. Malcolm X said in 1963, "When we see our people
being brutalized by white bigots, white racists, we think they are foolish to be
beaten and brutalized and do nothing whatsoever to protect themselves. They are
foolish. They should have the right to defend themselves against any attack made
against them by anyone . . . There will come a time when Black people wake up
and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves . . . then
the Black man will think like a Black man, and he will feel for other Black
people, and this new thinking and feeling will cause Black people to stick
together, and at that point you'll have a situation where when you attack one
Black man you are attacking all Black men." Asian America, where is our Che
Guevara, our Malcolm X? Our Martin Luther King, our Gandhi? How long can you
still tolerate bigotry with docile appeals to justice and equality? Careers in
medicine, law, academia, science, engineering, technology, finance, and business
yield ample paychecks as you recede into your suburbs, gated communities, and
bubbles of anonymia.

News articles are written on anything Asian that no one bothers to skim, Asian
films are released that few watch, Asian books are published that even fewer
read. Make it anyways. Our problem is our small population that doesn't boast
the power of market demand and the lack of a cultural identity beyond ethnic
enclaves that do not command anything more than comfort food. How do we coalesce
into an identity if we don't create one worth rallying behind and if we won't
bother with it ourselves? Will we remain perpetually non-belonging? Is this our
shared fate with the Jewish? Isaac Deutscher wrote, "Trees have roots. Jews have
legs." But let's not forget that the Jews fought back too in World War II, the
many resistors like Hannah Senesh who did not simply flee. Or Niuta Teitelbaum
who stood up to three Nazis: "She blushed, smiled meekly and then pulled out a
gun and shot each one. Two were killed, one wounded. Niuta, however, wasn't
satisfied. She found a physician's coat, entered the hospital where the injured
man was being treated, and killed both the Nazi and the police officer who had
been guarding him."

Asian America does not need more quants, engineers, software developers,
mathematicians, research scientists, physicists, venture capitalists. Asian
America cannot lift itself into a veritable tour de force if its members
consistently pursue money and material comfort in finance, STEM, medicine,
research. Asian America lacks a gravity uniting the community because there is
no central culture, no film festivals, no great writers, directors, no proud
achievement to pass on as cultural heritage. Few of us create, few of us consume
serious art, few pay attention to what these few produce, and even fewer listen
to our stories. For good reason: our art has not reached parity. To be taken
seriously, we must be serious about art and not settle for bubble tea and K-pop,
martial arts films and farcical comedies. The generation coming of age is paving
the way, and doing so in earnest, able to hold their own without pulling the
race card and decrying, "Please look at me, for I am unrepresented; pity me
because I'm human too." Even still, with this slew of modern artists from among
us, the story arc is something along the lines of pain, echoing figments of
immigration, family trauma, outsiderness. This is a necessary phase, to address
in proper faith the sorrows and longings, the lost ancestral ties, the real,
lived exerience of our parents and childhoods, to cement into the collective
language a history of a people that this time shall not be forgotten. This phase
is our current state and will continue for years to come. We must however come
to a point where we change course and stop milking the trauma and claim the full
richness of what it means to be an ordinary person like any other, to be human,
unafraid to seize joy and wonder. Our stories must evolve beyond this initial
reflecting mirror of reverberating helplessness and encompass comedy, elation,
mischief, pride, community, poverty and wealth, failure and triumph, indeed
happiness—all on our own terms, in our own channels, in accordance to our own
morality, history, customs. Community therapy through stories are but half the
battle when they only resolve the shame, guilt, regret, dissonance of growing up
a minority and stop short of the statuary pointing towards a sustainable, bright
future. We complain of the lack of media representation but where are our
screenwriters behind the films representing our voice? Why do we expect a white
writer to see our side when all he has are antiquated stereotypes? Correcting
media representation is not something that can be given to us but something we
must take up ourselves; no one but we ourselves is going to present our
narratives, our artists and film directors and writers, and not just reaching
parity in merit but exceeding. Where are those among us who will join those
who've come of age—Cathy Park Hong, Ocean Vuong, Charles Yu, Lee Isaac Chung,
Chloe Zhao? Where is the Asian American luminary? Who is the Asian American
voice? Where is our Charlie Kaufman, Aaron Sorkin, Quentin Tarantino, our
Tarkovsky, our Bergman? our James Baldwin, our Toni Morrison, our fearless
rallying architect, our central vision? Where are our art industries, our art
magnates, our art instructors, our art market, our art attendance that isn't
just gimmick picture-taking, admittance into the gallery out of resigned
ignorance? Asian America, upwardly mobile, lacks a body to call its own, its
doctors, engineers, bankers disperse on their own, with no home culture. Where
is our unique voice, our prose style, our cinematic direction, our elevated
lyricism, our vision on our own terms, ideated, designed, implemented,
propagated, and consumed all by ourselves? The rookie mistake is to produce what
Jay Caspian Kang calls dignity porn: "The type of story that takes the life of a
seemingly oppressed person, excavates all the differences compared with the
dominant culture and then seeks to hold these up in a soft, humanizing light.
Look, the dignity porno will say: 'Kimchi isn't weird. Ergo, we are as human as
you.'" This is what the dominant culture expects of the race narrative, and it
is precisely what we don't do because such a paradigm reaches no higher than the
fundamental limits inherent to the form, the subaltern deriving his value as a
proposition against the hegemony. Just as the feminist Germaine Greer did not
seek equality with men because she did not gauge the woman as a partial against
the man, we expect more of ourselves. We do not create for the white audience,
we do not invent for the dominant culture, we do not subject ourselves as
targets of that repulsive brand of exoticized slapstick comedy relegated to
foreigners, uncomprehending and incomprehensible in all ways except a clown's
incompetence, we do not plead for dignifiying humanity as a least common
denominator, we do not withdraw into spineless anonymity, we do not dance for
the white gaze. We create for ourselves, our community, our parents who've had
no voice, our children who shall find their own among the highest culture.
Whiteness is not our barometer. If the white audience takes notice, we will not
turn anyone away because we do not discriminate, but what they encounter will be
ours, on our own terms. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, "What is the difference
between a bookkeeper in the Garment District and a Supreme Court justice? One
generation."

I must be clear: I do not advocate segregation but instead an adequate
substantiation of one part of the American experience. I'm on the same page as
Obama when he said, "What makes America America is all the outsiders, the
misfits, and the folks who try to make something out of nothing. Let me tell you
about America. We're Lewis and Clark and Sacagawea. We're the pioneers and the
farmers and the miners and the entrepeneurs and the hucksters—thats our spirit.
That's who we are. We're Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer, women who could
do as much as any man and then some. And we're Susan B. Anthony who shook the
system until the law reflected that truth—that is our character. We're the
immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores, the huddled masses
yearning to breathe free, Holocaust survivors, Soviet defectors, the Lost Boys
of Sudan. We're slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South,
the ranch hands and the cowboys. We're the storytellers, writers, poets,
artists, who abore unfairness and despise hypocrisy and give voice to the
voiceless and tell truths that need to be told. We're the inventors of gospel
and jazz and blues and bluegrass and country and hip-hop—and rock and roll—in
our very own sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom. We are
Jackie Robinson enduring scorn in spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to
his head and stealing home in the World Series anyway. We are the people
Langston Hughes wrote of, 'who build our temples for tomorrow's strong as we
know how.' We are the people Emerson wrote of, 'who for truth and honor's sake
stand fast and suffer long, who are never tired so long as we can see far
enough'—that's what America is, not stock photos or airbrushed history, or
feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others. We respect
the past but we do not pine for the past. We do not fear the future; we grab
for it. America is not some fragile thing—we are large—in the words of Whitman,
'containing multitudes.' We are boisterous, and diverse, and full of energy,
perpetually young in spirit. That's why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old
age of 25 could lead a mighty march. We honor those who walked so we could run.
We must run so our children soar. And we will not grow weary for we believe in
the power of an awesome God, and we believe in this country's sacred promise."

How romantic an America! But oh, how so far away.

<h4>2021-03-11, 四. Excerpt from a departing missive, two years ago.</h4>
drifting in the clouds, continuing<br>
these wandering years<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            and not<br>
wading our eternities

<br>

Even above the clouds, in the void of space, a comet used to glide gracefully
across the night sky at the strike of dusk. On the wintry evening of November
13, 1877, a budding comet-chaser, convinced he was the first to lay eyes on the
elusive cosmic jewel, named it Ewelina Hańska, no doubt after the Polish
aristocrat whose intentional anonymity and sustained distance to a youthful
admirer resembled the comet's increasingly rare sightings. He wondered in
frustration why, unlike all the other comets whose periods only shortened, she
seemed to be defying the unbendable laws of gravity. After grappling at length
with his formulas, his only conclusion was this: originally appearing with
nightly certainty, she must have detected that her dances were being watched
and, for this very reason, altered the course of her elliptical orbit, slightly
delaying her next approach to earth each time she felt a pair of eyes on her
scintillating ice, because, in truth, even comets have their moods. The earthly
youth, condemned to his grounded fate, had no choice but to sit and wait
patiently under the sea of motionless stars. Never missing a night, he watched
in horror as the new interval of several days between her appearances not only
did not abate in mercy but grew steadily as days became weeks, and weeks into
months. Sitting by his telescope, he would look for her in the vastness of the
cosmos, along previous trails long ingrained in his memory, in the varied
constellations where she had never been, probing through misty nebulas and the
shadows of blinding stars, searching without rest or reason, bargaining with the
heavens that he would settle into bed if only he had one glimpse of her
elongated tail of frozen dust. Eventually he had no choice but to give in to his
desire, resorting to the comfort of rolling ice cubes on his tongue as he waited
so that he could know the taste of Ewelina Hańska: astral mystery. A tenacious
lad who had never known defeat, he followed his longing with discipline,
discovering for himself what many ambitious men before him have had to learn,
which is that sometimes victory is out of reach even when pursued by sheer force
of will. A look of perpetual confusion gradually settled on his face, and more
than once in the marketplace he heard someone describe his anxious expression as
the bearing of someone who has known great sorrow, but the permanent ridges of
incomprehension that resembled wrinkles on his cheeks and forehead never
occurred to him as anything more than the spoils of war. When at last her
absence had broken all astronomical records, he realized he did not need the
excitement of an actual sighting or even the regimen of his nightly telescopy,
for not a day had passed when something did not happen to remind him of her. How
do I know this? Last week as I was enjoying myself at the library, I found among
three others this comet-chaser's name in the obituary section in that period's
premier newspaper, preserved in microfilm, dated five decades after Ewelina
Hańska's first sighting. It seems that after she stopped returning, he soon
abandoned the profession. The last thing anyone heard of him was that he had
left intact his workstation under the open stars, his telescope pointed at the
direction from which she had always arrived, his folding chair still warm.

I remember a passage I first read years ago. I must've been on the subway on
some odd afternoon when, seated at one end I saw myself in Mary Oliver's words:
"It is six A.M., and I am working. I am absentminded, reckless, heedless of
social obligations, etc. It is as it must be. The tire goes flat, the tooth
falls out, there will be a hundred meals without mustard. The poem gets written.
I have wrestled with the angel and I am stained with light and I have no shame.
Neither do I have guilt. My responsibility is not to the ordinary, or the
timely. It does not include mustard, or teeth. It does not extend to the lost
button, or the beans in the pot. My loyalty is to the inner vision, whenever and
howsoever it may arrive. If I have a meeting with you at three o'clock, rejoice
if I am late. Rejoice even more if I do not arrive at all."

<h4>2021-03-02, 二.</h4>

Last night I was in the Jordan Hall of Science scanning midterm exams to grade
later when I was brought to a pause in the day's motions.  It was that time
after classes had ended for the day and before what must commonly be dinnertime,
when the lecture halls and lobbies are empty under the quiet cover of the dark
night outside. I was standing in front of the scanner when I stopped for a
second, noticing the music. It was one of those small moments of unexpected
beauty, a spontaneous, joyful surprise. Someone downstairs was playing the
piano. Music flowed undisturbed through the multiple floors of the open atrium,
in that emptiness of an expansive space with high ceilings and a long hall but
without footsteps, without chatter, without presence. I resumed scanning the
pile of exams, deciding it was pleasant background music for a chore. Listening
a bit more, I recognized it was HALLELUJAH. It must've been a student playing
because of the intermittent missed note and brief halt, but these mishaps
weren't distracting enough to detract from the music. There is a rawness and
honesty in live music that is lost when it becomes too practiced, too
calculated, too professional, or when recorded to perfection and replayed until
the cows come home. She played HALLELUJAH a few times and then switched to a few
more with Pachelbel's CANON IN D. Removing a staple from an exam, I thought,
isn't this nice? There is beauty and delight even in the unprovoked moments when
I'm not seeking it. At that moment, I was content just being, to go about my day
doing something as simple as plucking out staples from paper, placing the paper
on a tray, and hitting two buttons on a screen. Why all my rages and
resignations? I wondered whether I shouldn't have done something like this
instead from the start, undemanding, uneventful, so that I may have had more
time and energy to cultivate inner peace. Maybe a librarian, an office clerk, a
lab technician? Wittgenstein at one point decided to be a hospital porter, that
monastic wanderer. A few years ago I planned a two-week trip to Kyoto,
entertaining the idea of becoming a monk. Needless to say, I didn't end up
renouncing the world; the visits to the temple were enough of a reality check.

Driving home, the piano's unexpected delight lingered, and I felt the vestiges
of a scene from THE SOPRANOS. A.J., the grandson, who recently discovered
existentialism through Nietzsche, visits his grandmother Livia in the hospital.
Livia, in the wizened brevity of those in old age who know too well the futility
of beating around the bush, tells the usual consequences of existential dread,
as cliche and dull as they are true. She says, "Why does everything have to have
a purpose? . . . If you want my advice, Anthony, don't expect happiness. You
won't get it, people let you down . . . but in the end you die in your own
arms." Indeed, the usual boring riff of disillusionment with life. So? What's
new? And then she ends with a thought that doesn't feel like the punch in the
gut that it is because she doesn't weigh down her delivery with the heavy tones
of grand philosophy: "It's all a big nothing. What makes you think you're so
special?"

Aye, Livia. You and me both.

<h4>2021-02-26, 五. On the Artist as Eccentric.</h4>
Why is it so common to find among creatives intolerable stubbornness,
intractable visions, beings who not only create uncanny works but also live in
aberration? The roaring litany of writers and artists, comedians and activists,
philosphers and actors, all those whose independence demand they be
uncompromisingly themselves, count among their ranks disproportionately
tumultuous lives where madness, passion, obsession, ailment, and insanity
correlate with ingenuity—so much so that this observation can be made: the more
eccentric the artist, the more productive and outstanding. This is as it must
be. The nature of art does not call for reason, health, normalcy, or sustainable
living, but rather an open embrace of the vivacity of life, whether they be
struck by calamity, malady, treason, failure, despair, subject entirely to
factors beyond their control, and then having the wisdom to recognize it in the
mirror and follow it.

The artist does not concern himself with the illusory promise of happiness and
joy because his muse never appears when happy. Rather, the artist does not
resist and even pursues the experimental, the new, the traces of suffering that
lead further and further into himself. How do we explain this trait that artists
take for granted as dearly as life's motto? Others have written about this
potent capacity. Keats called it negative capability. Martha Nussbaum said of
Mahler's KINDERTOTENLIEDER (tr. Songs on the Death of Children): "That music is
consoling because it brings you to terms with the finality of loss in such an
eloquent way. Now, I wouldn't have said of the KINDERTOTELIEDER, that's a
beautiful work. I think most listeners wouldn't use that word. It's a harrowing
work, but it's precisely for that reason that it's consoling . . . To me the
greatness of Mahler is his getting to the depths of the inexorability of loss,
and the real, deep pain that human life affords, and I think if you can't get to
the depth of that pain you also can't get to the heights of the joy of human
life." The artist reeks in Nietzsche's superman who said: "But you, also, my
brethren, tell me: What does your body say about your soul? Is your soul not
poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency? . . . What is the greatest
thing you can experience? It is the hour of great contempt. The hour in which
even your happiness becomes loathsome to you, and so also your reason and
virtue. The hour when you say: 'What good is my happiness? It is poverty and
pollution and wretched self-complacency.'" It is not without reason that
Tolstoy's ANNA KARENINA opens with, "All happy families are alike; every unhappy
family is unhappy in its own way". What story is there to tell that ends with
smiles all around? It is finished at the full stop. The principal trouble isn't
that there is a lack of content but that any such story does not even intend to
capture the human experience in any adequate form, real or imagined, but only a
sorry fantasy. There is a reason no serious artist or critic concerns himself
with happiness. To have a joyful, gregarious, harmonious life is to sedate those
impulses of the self that embody the wonderful spectrum of humanity. Happiness
is pleasing. Happiness fulfills. Happiness quenches. Happiness is indolent
satisfaction. Happiness does not answer the call to meaning—happiness is boring.
A happy story represents nothing. It says nothing, it expresses nothing—it is
nothing. Not every artist can explain what drives him, but all have at least
this in common, an instinctive understanding of what doesn't work. To be clear,
I need to add a disclaimer that I am not an elitist. Conventional happy stories
have a time and place, and the market that caters to it, with public's appetite
for it, have the purpose of leisure and entertainment for normal people who have
jobs in the day and families at home, and the producers for this market are
bounds and away more influential than any avant-garde conception sequestered in
exclusive circles. I enjoyed THE GAME OF THRONES too, but don't expect me to
take it seriously, or THE HUNGER GAMES, or any superhero amusement park like THE
AVENGERS coming out of Hollywood. They were not made for the artist and do not
expand human consciousness, they do not belong in the same category as Proust or
Hugo, and so do not deserve the  same consideration. Artists are eccentrics for
a reason. One does not expect a scientist to be without his discipline and
objectivity, so how can one expect an artist to live in conformity and produce
mere replicas of what already exists? How can one critique in earnest the
society in which he lives when he breathes in it, when behind his white lies he
stands to lose the most from brutal honesty? But also, how does the artist know
what he's talking about unless he's lived in it?

Difficult childhoods, agitation, disturbed thoughts, and uncommon life
experiences are also what fuel stand-up comedians for whom reality and society
as given do not give proper venue to adequate expression. How disaffected were
Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, and Sarah Silverman that they could not look at life
without also seeing its magnificent comedy, that which doesn't even cross the
minds of normal people? Such torment is also what strikes a comedian as
intellectual as Stephen Fry. And it is not only creatives who are capable of an
alternate view. Jane Goodall, who never planned on becoming a scientist but
rather thought of herself as an artist who wanted to live among animals in
Africa and write about them, spent who knows how long on her own in the forest,
and she said, "Some people will pick out tiny things as beauty. Other people
won't even notice them. The shape of a wet leaf on the pavement, even in an ugly
place. A footstep on the sand filling up with water. The whole picture you can
get—a child's footprint and a dog's paw, and a tide coming in—can be very
beautiful. Other people might just tramp over them and not see them at all." She
said too, "A simple fly landed on me—this one was shining green and gold, and it
had little specks of red— beautiful fly, bristly fur on its abdomen. And I
looked at it and thought, when a chimpanzee looks at something like this, he
doesn't have the word, the word 'fly'. So he's looking at it as it is. Now I'm
imagining myself being in a situation of not having words, so if I can
categorize it as a fly it takes away from something of the beauty of the
moment—because it's just a 'fly'—so forget 'fly' and look at this being that's
there." How can an artist be a reiteration of the cookie-cutter norm of
conformity? Someone wholesome and functional is amenable and pleasant and may be
unconditionally kind and deserving of kindness in return, yet these traits of
rigid regularity are confining and sterile. Normal people, like anyone, are to
be treated with customary courtesy but it would be a mistake to expect them
to take the artist where he wishes to go. At the end of the day, an
artist can speak his mind only with another artist, and separating him from
everyone else is the unbridgeable gap between forever strangers. This notion is
crucial, especially for the artist, whose value is his vision. The image of the
artist as disturbed, reclusive, tormented, is the right one. Privacy and
seclusion are essential to being oneself. Without his privacy, how could Sacha
Baron Cohen have concocted his social and political vessel to become a
ridiculous buffoon like BORAT? Frances McDormand, who shuns the usual Hollywood
celebrity and lives away from the limelight, unencumbered by maintaining an
image of propriety, not hidden behind seven layers of makeup, not draped in the
season's designer advertisement, could not but be genuine. She lives remotely,
modestly, saying, "I get to live my more authentic self here, and I don't have
to pretend to be anybody else." Why do we suppose hardly anyone has seen Thomas
Pynchon? The idea is the same as when Thoreau sought to confront only "the
essential facts of life." Rousseau wrote REVERIES OF THE SOLITARY WALKER. And do
we fault William Blake for his singular vision? Or Proust who retired from the
world to write his novel, the man who, having lived life, sat down to write
about it? Or Aaron Swartz for abhorring the white noise in the office? Rilke
wrote, "We are solitary. We can delude ourselves about this and act as if it
were not true. That is all. But how much better it is to recognize that we are
alone; yes, even to begin from this realization."

The artist, accustomed to time alone, dedicated to communicating through his
work, does not have the habit of doing so in person. When his interviewer
expressed frustration at eliciting a response, Coetzee said, "The questions you
have posed to me are, many of them, difficult questions, and it's my habit of
mind to reflect and revise and try to attain a certain completion and perfection
in my responses, and that is incompatible with the interview medium. That's why
I've been so extremely uncomfortable." Coetzee belongs to the category of
artists who are not outwardly striking but instead modest and unassuming, who
live largely uneventful lives outside of their work, as do I. I do believe that
I speak for the artists in this category when I say our ideas come not from
outside but from within, and any perturbance on our part only distracts us from
seeing the vision. A painter expressed my experience of artistic creation when
he said, "I wait till the inner lights to go on. The inner light means it's the
moment I start to paint. If the inner light goes on in me I start right away to
paint, everything is there, the paint, the canvas. And I paint till the end, but
there's no end. I live in a lawless world. There is no law. The end is spiritual
orgasm . . . You have to sit and wait until the inner light goes on.  It is only
by sitting and waiting, if you wait for the inner lights to go on, then you can
talk. Now I have contact with the planet, the surroundings. It has nothing to do
with logical or practical things. Speaking like practical, logical,
philosophical people is not the real way. It is the wrong way. Clever, handy,
routine is the wrong way. You have sit and wait until the inner lights go on in
you and then we can talk." I don't think myself a kind person, or particularly
humble, try as I may. When the moment strikes, I sit quietly and write wherever
I happen to be, and the affair is entirely without spectacle. To watch me
writing would be beside the point. It is entirely a solitary process and not one
worth witnessing. What matters is what comes out as a result of subsuming all
senses, imagination, experience, sentiment, an eye attentive to life, trusting
an unwavering taste to channel what is worth writing into the written word. It
would not be productive to ask me how I wrote it either because  I myself do not
know. Csikszentmihalyi called this experience "flow", but there's a distinction
to be made between the rational and the creative processes. The throes of
engagement when writing a computer program does not feel the same as the chaos
and darkness of writing prose that's at risk of slipping away. I can write
comments about what I wish to code and come back later; I don't have that luxury
with prose that runs dry when I've lost how I wanted to write it. The ideas I
hear from the inner voice in the passing moments that I deem worth writing are
not easily reproducible and only seem they can after the fact because they sit
on the page, outside my head. When I finish a coding session I emerge with a
sense of completion in the head, the kind of lifeless, fading satisfaction that
comes with overcoming an intellectual puzzle. But with prose, after long hours
swimming in the night ocean, the weary soul attains a deep satiety that isn't
quite joy so much as a sense of meaning from having danced with life.

Elon Musk was right when he said that companies should "spend less time on
finance, spend less time in conference rooms, less time on PowerPoint and more
time just trying to make [their] product as amazing as possible." But he stops
short of the reason those in management refuse to do the obvious and innovate.
He is asking MBAs, whose primary value proposition is to stand before an
audience and sell fancy numbers tacked onto colorful pictures, to use skillsets
they don't have and be engineers and designers, thinkers and experimentalists,
to give themselves over to late nights in the office, putting off family duties,
placing the product above themselves. Erving Goffman called it "body glossing"
when someone explicitly signals to others his activity that is otherwise
indiscernible—checking our phone as we wait in a lobby to inform passersby that
we're waiting for someone. When an MBA stands in front of a slide deck, the
entire body is glossing. Title and formality, power and position, capital and
distance secure a comfort that resists change and new ideas. Who doesn't want to
be a visionary? But what does it cost? The flip side of this coin is that it is
unreasonable to expect everyone to be a relentless innovator. Whether it is the
changing priorities in life as we age, our divergent aspirations due to
different backgrounds, our accustomed privilege, one cannot expect the bulk of
the workforce to demand on themselves a rocketship's takeoff protracted to a
lifetime, exhilarating and glorious but also consuming and precarious.
Innovators, radicals, and progressives are and will continue to remain a faint
portion of society, loud and inspiring but few and precious. Most of us, indeed,
are content being normal: a job is just a job. How dispiriting! and yet how true
to human nature! and I too shall one day fall in place! A voice in me bares
itself and screams: Have you sailed the seven seas, summited K2's peak, unveiled
the secrets of humanity, pried into the mysteries of the universe, have you
become all that which you aspired to be, have you pushed the boulder up the
mountain enough times, have you seen the apocalypse and returned to live your
days knowing you've reached the end, that there was no more, have you tapped
into the wavelength of what it means to be alive, a fragile collection of
stardust that wonders its place among the stars? Writing's music cannot express
convulsive pangs as purely as music in the plain, heard over shut eyes—I am
reminded of Michael Nyman's TIME LAPSE. And so too I am reminded of Hesse:
"Eternity is a mere moment, just long enough for a joke."

<h4>2021-02-20, 六. How it Ends and Elsewhere Begins Anew.</h4>
A daughter returns to Greece with her father who was born there. He is returning
to exhume his mother. The country's shortage of burial space means the dead lie
in rented land, staying for three years before their family must come to
retrieve their bones to make room for someone else. The uncle hadn't left the
small town with the father decades ago and is the one digging. He clears away
the soil, pulling up bits of coffin and bone. The Greeks bury their dead facing
west, where the sun sets and where life ends. The daughter is next to her
father. First comes the skull with the hair still brown. Then a shoulder bone, a
clavicle, and some ribs. The daughter takes a second to look at her father and
then back to her uncle. More bones come up, and he reaches a femur and the feet.
The uncle steps out. He and the father put the pieces together with their hands.
When they are done, the daughter looks at her father who is looking at his
mother assembled on the ground. The daughter feels guilty when the thought
occurs to her that she might one day stand where her father is. The thought
lingers for a second before she glances at the ground and thinks, that's where
life once was. Only the three of them are present, and the ceremony has no music
or fanfare. Her father will box his mother's remains and bring them to a room
that also houses others she'd grown up with. A gentle breeze in the air. The
daughter knows that when she returns to work next week, she will have to rejoin
her colleagues in the usual office banter. The sun is heavy this afternoon but
she knows too the sun does not shine for her.

<h4>2021-02-11, 四. On Race, Diversity, and Immigration.</h4>
Today's post is delicate for obvious reasons. Reader be warned, this may make
you more uncomfortable than my other posts, but this is an important issue to
explore.<br>
___

Let's cast aside the political polarization for a moment and have a mature
conversation on race and the future identity of America. It's not popular these
days but I don't think it's inherently racist to talk about race and its
practical consequences, from both perspectives: the white's and the person of
color's. There are very real issues that have to be addressed. The recent rise
of neo-Nazies, conspiracy theories, and white supremacism is not possible under
a well-functioning democracy. It only happens when people are insecure and under
threat, and this threat stems from 1) poor white folks who feel the country has
forgotten them and 2) the rapid demographic changes are altering the country's
identity. I have nothing insightful to say about the first reason on top of the
obvious need to address the problem. This post addresses the second reason.

<b>Discontent</b>

Here are the facts.
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/03/14/the-us-will-become-minority-white-in-2045-census-projects/">Estimates</a>
project that the country will become majority non-white in 2045. It's very soon—
I'll likely still be alive when it happens. What do whites, who are losing
representation, think of this? A
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/03/21/views-of-demographic-changes-in-america/">survey</a>
found nearly as many view it positively (26%) as negatively (28%).

I'd like to first write a bit with the 28% in mind. At the extreme is the
far-right. Richard Spencer, Lauren Southern, and Gavin McInnes are saying, "We
built the wealthiest nation on Earth, we introduced democracy and defended it,
we created a free state for all, we created the modern world, and who are these
foreigners coming over and stealing our inheritance from us?" This is indeed the
reality, and I have to say, they have a point. There's a conversation to be had,
certainly not one I can settle but let's examine this further. My view in the
end is that resources, opportunities, and equitable values should not be hoarded
within lines as arbitrary as race.

It's worth repeating: I don't think it's racist to talk about whites wishing to
preserve Western civilization. It's a matter of defensive self-conservation. The
far right is the loudest but in today's intolerance that's the only venue to
voice this defensive stance. Again I don't think this is racist but their
concern is they're being pushed out. I read this from somewhere online—to my
fellow liberals, this might be useful to see where the right is coming
from—consider a white person moving to China and demanding that Chinese culture
be moved aside, that the Chinese should lose rights for racial equality, and
that the Chinese should be disarmed and have no option to push back. It's not
racist but such actions provoke self-defense even by a neutral bystander. The
question is whether it's fair to believe the dominant culture of the country
(white culture) would be happy becoming just another minority group and losing
the power it's had since the country's inception. I'd like to believe so because
the way forward for the country is to accommodate all Americans but I suspect
many white folks, openly or privately, don't—specifically the 28% in the survey
who didn't even bother pretending. The question isn't about equality. The
country's changing racial demographics is like saying: imagine a Britain that's
not predominantly British or a China that's not predominantly Chinese. And no
matter our skin color, if any of us takes a stroll along the Seine in Paris and
see more Muslims in hijabs than the original French, does Paris feel French?
This is the unsettling reality. Suppose for a moment that we lifted every poor
white American out of poverty and secured their future prospects. Even then,
would they be happy with no longer being able to identify with what the country
is becoming? Conservatives feel their homeland is being hijacked even while we
progressives see inequality at every turn. It's a problem in Europe too with the
Syrian refugee crisis. Whiteness, Christianity, and the European identity that
built the country are being threatened and what we're doing is blanket-blocking
any mention of it as racist when there's a valid point here.

This problem extends to academia. A very recent vanguard in the humanities has
essentially been saying: "we" have been oppressed, colonialized,
underrepresented, and now that we're empowered we're going to take what's ours
and air our dirty laundry. I'm not saying their push for equality is wrong but
that they leave no room for the other side in a climate of cancel culture. Think
of all the academics whose entire careers are based on what is now blatantly
called imperialist and colonialist. The premise of the country as a free state
where all are equal is not possible when we are separating ourselves into
piecemeal subcultures defending our turf. America cannot be an either/or but has
to be an inclusive both/and. Among many other adjustments, the required
coursework reading may very well have to change from the exclusively white
Western canon and the field may need some serious reflection on its context and
history, but this doesn't mean dissolving the discipline, as Dan-el Padilla
Peralta is open to doing with the classics. Let's recall that even ideas as
radically departing from traditional Western perspective as those in Edward
Said's ORIENTALISM didn't call for destroying the whole field.

What is happening is human nature: everyone pursues his interest, and it is the
country that plays mediator for all citizens. Can we each stop demonizing the
other side? It is useful to keep in mind John Rawls' veil of ignorance and take
a step back from our particular place in society to think larger. With America
soon to become majority non-white, we have to make peace with that fact. Now,
onto something more interesting.

<b>Towards a Brighter Future</b>

This is sobering: a
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376654">study</a>
last year found that when people are forming teams and adding members, they
deliberately reduce diversity when they are shown whether a potential member
boosts or drops the team's overall diversity. This behavior looms large.
For all we tout diversity in our public relations messaging, for all the
apparent diversity in cities, residential neighborhoods are largely segregated
by race, even in our most diverse cities:
<a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/page-elements/academics-research-centers-initiatives/centers-and-institutes/center-for-urban-research/cur-research-initiatives/the-end-of-segregation-hardly">New York City</a>,
<a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/racial-segregation-san-francisco-bay-area">San Francisco</a>, and
<a href="https://today.uic.edu/new-report-details-chicagos-racial-ethnic-disparities">Chicago</a>.
And <a href="http://racialdotmap.demographics.coopercenter.org">this</a> map
shows the race distribution in the country using the 2010 census data, with one
dot per person, each dot colored by race. This is the undeniable state of
affairs: de facto segregation. Residential segregation translates to school
segregation. <a href="https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/30098/why-have-americas-public-schools-gotten-more-racially-segregated">These</a>
maps show segregation consistent with the country's racialized geography, and
this is over half a century after <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.
Whatever image of a racially integrated country we may have in mind is not just
overly optimistic but entirely wrong. PRRI
<a href="https://www.prri.org/research/poll-race-religion-politics-americans-social-networks/">surveyed</a>
racial compositions in 2013 of social networks within racial groups and
revealed shocking homogenity. Among whites, 91% of friends are also white,
among Blacks, 83% are Black, and among Hispanics, 64% are Hispanic. And Asians?
No data for us. We're invisible. But these numbers remind me of Beverly
Daniel Tatum's WHY ARE ALL THE BLACK KIDS SITTING TOGETHER? because of its
title and how it cuts at the core of the matter. What is disheartening is I have
not even the slightest instinct to say these numbers are out of touch with
reality. What about the entertainment we consume? A
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/61/2/369/4098571">study</a>
found "[w]hite participants showed significantly less interest in seeing movies
with mostly Black casts than in seeing movies with mostly [w]hite casts."
Another
<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1996-05-02-1996123149-story.html">study</a>
found that whites and Blacks have few favorite TV shows in common.
And books? I couldn't find a study on this, but let's be honest. If we can't
even bring ourselves to watch movies and TV across race, how many do we suppose
have read James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, or Toni Morrison? Or Zadie Smith, Salman
Rushdie, Orhan Pamuk?

So we don't live together, don't go to the same schools, aren't friends with
each other, don't watch the same movies or TV shows, and if we meet each other
at work what guides our conversations is a societal restraint from broaching
race that precludes any serious discussion and mingling. How then are we to make
friends across racial lines if we don't have much in common, can't point out the
obvious, and skirt about the issue by talking shop, and when we invite that
friend to our circle of largely homogenous friends we are also transferring the
burden of restraint to them? And what are we talking about when we say with such
conviction that we understand the Black plight or that of other minorities who
have been less abused and less disenfranchised over the course of the country's
history if the immensity of our unquestioned confidence comes from—indeed
betrays—our own realities, our projected mythologies and imaginations exchanged
among friends, cloistered in our communities where everyone looks and thinks
like ourselves?

Racial inequality is something we can't help but pick up on. We adults don't
talk about it because we've learned restraint, afraid of saying the wrong thing,
and instead keep quiet or look away. Kids notice it too but are more open to
speaking their minds. In the podcast NICE WHITE PARENTS, the host Chana
Joffe-Walt describes this kind of situation when white students, who bring more
funding power, started enrolling at a predominantly Black and Hispanic middle
school: "These boys, even at 11 years old, they've absorbed the same messages
that [the school] wasn't so good before. It was a bad school. He and his
friends, they've turned the school around. That's what he's learning." This is
what the boy in question said: "The kids wouldn't pay attention. And they had,
like--got to, like, zone out every little thing. And I bet they learned very
little. And now this generation with us, I think we're doing a lot better. And I
think that we're learning at a much faster pace." This comment isn't racist so
much as it's an innocent observation of a consequence of our education system
and a history of suppression, and what he is saying is something we all notice
when we come across it, but the current political and social climate casts over
us a pall that mutes what we already know as wise silence.

Here I digress to put in a word on immigration. Like any proper New Yorker, I am
a flaming liberal. I support the idea of equal opportunity for all whether in
this country or in any other. In spite of this, I don't think the answer to the
immigration question is to throw open our doors and let everyone in. There is a
limit to how many the country can tolerate without bankrupting the social
system. David Frum
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/">notes</a>
the practical concerns of immigration, that immigrants cost the
government more than they contribute in taxes. A part of me says this is the
price of an egalitarianism, but this deficit also surfaces a brutal reality. How
can we accommodate indefinitely more immigrants when our country is already
steep in debt and millions of our own, those we look in the eye as our fellow
Americans, are struggling? Frum advocates focusing our immigration policy to
accept highly skilled immigrants—doctors and engineers—who earn their keep and
help the country remain innovative. This, of course, means a continual brain
drain from their home countries, which strangely enough has been found to
increase wages and democratic values back home. I'm not convinced, however, that
losing a nation's best and brightest helps a developing country stand on its own
and catch up rather than merely benefiting indirectly from Western progress. But
this is the price of supplying American innovation, securing American
well-being.

Diversity—why is it so difficult? I'm an atheist, yet I've sat with a Protestant
as he prayed for me, I've linked hands with Catholics saying grace before a
meal, I've attended Mass, I've sat in classes full of Catholics. I've joined the
Muslim retreat at the Blue Mosque as the muezzin called and witnessed the hall's
worshipers kneeling on the floor in prayer. I put on a kippah in Jerusalem and
stood face-to-face with the Wailing Wall. I sat among the local community in
Mumbai at a Hindu engagement ceremony. So what that I'm an atheist? We should
keep in mind that what feels foreign to one is home to another, and it was the
arbitrary slight of chance that we ourselves were not born into another's
community.

Diversity is the country's future, and it is a future when the landscape of
writers and directors will have changed, along with the TV-watching and
movie-going market whose preference commands what the entertainment industry
produces. One day, this era's fight for social justice, equal representation,
true equality under law and its enforcement, will have been but one chapter in
the transition to a more equitable world. And one day, we will not think it out
of the ordinary that a lead actor is brown though we notice it and are aware of
the long struggle that made such casting possible, and we will not be
uncomfortable watching a person of color rejoice or sulk or have the full range
of experiences of any ordinary human. One day, the unsightly practice will have
passed when the camera deigns a moment for the diversity shot and then cuts
away, returning to the default whiteness. The country's future is mixed, and we
have to accept this as a reality, not boil over with veiled resentment.

William Buckley wrote, "A conservative is someone who stands athwart history,
yelling Stop." What nonsense! How shortsighted is his view of history that for
him, history extends no further than the past several hundred years since the
Great Divergence that marked the West's emergence as the world's wealthiest and
most advanced civilization, and he happened to have lived in the period when
such self-flattery is possible. The one constant that endures time is change,
and just as no individual lives forever in his youthful peak, no society is
immune to its evolving fortunes. How many came before who met worse fates have
had to accept change? Russians, Indians, Chinese, Persians, Turks, Aztecs,
Egyptians, and all those who belonged to once thriving civilizations: if it is
any consolation, others have been here before, and the decline of white power
in America is one peaceful tick of change in the ocean of our inflated
self-importance. How many in those prior civilizations screamed that the end is
nigh, yet the world has moved on, and they carry about themselves in it as
routinely as the Earth revolves around the Sun? It's always irked me how any
mentioning the fall of the Roman Empire carries an air of puritanical
nationalism, that it is with resignation that such greatness came to an end. It
certainly was great, but we give the invaders who brought its fall the
exceedingly flattering name of barbarians even though they too had families and
lives, pursuing their interests just as the Romans theirs, and these barbaric
tribes don't seem barbarians any longer when we name them properly: the Franks
settling in modern France, the Visigoths in modern Spain, the ancestors of the
moderns. We sympathize so intensely with the Romans because we see only one
side, and the fact that we continue to use the word barbarians descends from
this lineage—it's what the Romans called outsiders. It is worth reminding
ourselves the truth Carl Sagan pointed out in COSMOS: "National boundaries are
not evident when we view the Earth from space. Fanatical ethnic or religious or
national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain when we see our planet
as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous point of light
against the bastion and citadel of the stars." That blue crescent formed
4,500,000,000 years ago, of which we humans developed agriculture in the last
12,000 and began laying the foundation for civilization. It is outright foolish
to think that human culture has peaked and should change no further. The future
of the country is diversity and what must happen: acceptance and unity, not
separation and exclusion. Why not imagine a future where we contain Whitman's
multitudes? Across canyons and valleys, lush green praries and eroded rock
strewn over sand-blown desert, towering mesas and redwood forests, we find
small towns and major metropolises decorating the land under the snow-capped
mountains, for we are all of us American: brown and yellow and black and white
and blue and red, bound not by prescriptions of the isolated echo chambers that
came before but by a full forward march, hand in hand, towards a history that
will bear our names in pioneering pride. When we were children we saw ourselves
as adventurers and explorers, looking out at a world full of mystery, curious
at everything, unafraid to learn, elated to be alive. Where has that sense of
awe and wonder gone?

<h4>2021-02-09, 二. In Defense of Abstract Art.</h4>
Why view abstract art? When we stand before an abstract painting, what is it
that we're looking at in the indeterminate swirls that don't even remotely
resemble a person, a place, or anything familiar? I wish to address why I prefer
abstraction.

If we can represent nature by reducing it into a set of equations, why not too
visual expression into art's purest form? And what is visual art on the canvas
but the strokes of a brush painting in the four variables of color, shape, size,
and space? Consider Mondrian, Rothko, and Kandinsky. They use these variables to
their own vision, and even with such a small arsenal, how can we say their
compositions are anything but wholly unlike each other? It is often mentioned
that abstract paintings lack technical difficulty. To this I say that the
difficulty of abstraction is in the conception which requires a certain
maturity, not in the elitist sense, but in the capacity to grasp symbolism to
its devastating potential. One way to conceive of the world is to view nature
and the universe as the eternal constants in which we measly humans flicker by,
but another, equally valid one is to place ourselves at the central vantage
point because what will it all have mattered if we don't exist? To appreciate
abstraction is to take the leap from merely mimicking reality, scrupulously
copying down its concretized distinctions and its various shades of light, to
human expression, the crux of what it means to be alive.

I remember the first time I encountered Barnett Newman's VIR HEROICUS SUBLIMIS.
I was pulled to it as if by a magnet, drawn up close to the life-sized red
canvas, the red consuming my entire field of vision, and I felt shivers running
down my spine. Staring straight ahead, I felt transported to another realm, and
what ran through me for a full minute was a whole world of sensory saturation.
The canvas encased all passion, all desire, all rage, all triumph, and it was
surging excitement, jubilation: the sublime. What I felt was nothing less than
the chaos of the universe, human folly, birth and death, our meaningless
motions, coming together in a form so simple. It is an overflowing power even
though the painting does not laboriously enumerate all human mistakes under the
sky, it does not have any semblance of a character or story, it doesn't have any
material substance other than color and size, for this impalpability mirrors
what we have in the end: nothing. And this sensory experience is the meaning of
the work, needing no other indication than the title: Man Heroic Sublime. Some
attempt to approach the painting using traditional methods, examining its
construction and the artist's background. To do so is to have missed the point.
They place undue emphasis on the vertical lines, the zips, and deconstruct the
order in which Newman painted them—it's a rather simple exercise of withholding
some vertical space with tape and then either painting between a pair or
painting around one. But this is not the right way to look at the painting, and
we do not understand the painting through its technicalities any more than we
get closer to understanding what enables life by analyzing the brain's atomic
makeup. The zips merely serve to provide a sense of size for a painting that
stands taller than any viewer.

I am not suggesting that expression and meaning is limited to abstraction's
dominion. Consider Norman Rockwell's undeniably political THE PROBLEM WE ALL
LIVE WITH, or Caspar David Friedrich's proud WANDERER ABOVE THE SEA OF FOG, or
Giorgio de Chirico's dreary THE MELANCHOLY OF DEPARTURE, or the contrast of
human transience and the mountain's unfazed apathy in Hokusai's EJIRI IN THE
SURUGA. Let's not forget Yayoi Kusama's more visceral infinity mirror
installations that manifest her internal world, rife with obsessions, a black
room illuminated by floating lights all around, all receding into the horizon, a
world on fire from which there is no escape, a world into which the public
voluntarily steps. Or the same concept rendered more explicit in Edvard Munch's
THE SCREAM, which unlike the former cannot be misinterpreted as just a pretty
picture. What I am saying is abstraction's poignance arises from its simplicity
that is too often overlooked, a simplicity that not only enhances a painting's
lyric capacity but elevates the art by inflecting upon its very medium so that
the artist, the process, the art meld into one. Why should a Ronnie Landfield
stare at us less directly and speak to us from further away than Vermeer's GIRL
WITH A PEARL EARRING? In one brush stroke dashing across the surface, one color
reaching upwards, dancing among many in our human dynamism, we see not a
landscape or a portrait but a visual ode singing the tune of our inner
complexity.

To stay clear of art's mystique, I must mention the regrettable reality is that
any mention of art is preceded by its reputation. In this sense, art is like
wine tasting. Wine tasting and, even more importantly, the acquired diction
developed to describe it unfortunately connote class aspiration, class
maintenance, and the whole system of media that reinforce wine's continued
esteem and consumption. We don't dwell a second on wine's unfermented cousin,
the unremarkable grape juice, but we go to considerable lengths to distinguish
between wines by variety, region, year, and color. Though we may sensibly
separate a heavy malbec from a mild pinot noir, when we start throwing around
phrases like "flavor of blackberry", "notes of earthy vanilla", "hints of
seasoned red plum", and "a rich dark chocolate lingering in the aftertaste",
all the while affecting a poker face as we swirl and sniff ourselves into high
oblivion, should we not ask ourselves if there might not be a more productive
use of time than making an impression? Any genuine appreciation for wine is
quickly extinguished when artifice enters the conversation. So too is art when
we chase the big name, attach a price tag, and enshroud it in undue mystery.
The art market has not escaped the American variety of ruthless capitalism, and
decades of rising economic inequality has permitted the rise of rogue
billionaires who patronize rogue artists like Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons. Why
do some artists fetch handsome sums at Christie's or Sotheby's while many of
their peers struggle, forced to sell their work on the street? There is a
market whose taste is determined by an exclusive community, and the clients,
keen on entertaining guests of similar standing, viewing a painting as an
investment, patting themselves on the back for procuring a rarefied treasure
for the spouse, transact in prestige which, too, can be bought. The truth is
that the CEOs, the hedge fund managers, and those in the professional class
whose wealth has passed the threshold where capital allocation alone suffices
for comfortable living have not, over the course of their upward career
trajectory, had the time to calibrate artistic taste. The real artist,
dedicated to his craft as a parent to a child, for whom art is a means of
living, is at the mercy of the tastemakers, the curators, the established
critics. Such is the art market. But American capitalism, ever eager to place
its hand on every exchange, bends the market to its own morality. This is not
art for art's sake but raw capitalism. Let us appreciate art on its own accord,
art for all. As Jerry Saltz says, anyone can look at art—including abstract
art.

<h4>2019-10-19, 六. On Humility.</h4>
I came across some old archives from my college. In them, photos—I'll provide
the links at the end of this entry, but it is my hope that the reader resist
the itch to scroll down. The plague of modernity, fragmented, interrupting,
dispersed across screens, paper, devices, copies and versions, scrambled notes
and secluded apps, cross-referencing links, bold images and billboard pizzazz,
chaos and dementia all vying for attention, is not the lack of information but
the senseless deluge of it. In these old archives, photos: a past era spread
across decades, from the early to late 1900s. The exact dates, just one window
among many, are not important. Age is apparent in the photos: black-and-white,
the box desktop monitor, the oversized eyeglasses common in a bygone era. An
image of the building facade I know so well, that entrance colonnade, the
familiar study rooms and library stacks, the exposed brick in the background
whose texture I can still feel on my fingertips, whose varying shades of deep
tan at the front of a lecture hall I can still see from the back row. Photos of
students and professors, angled over a book, gesturing against a blackboard, a
chin resting on a palm. These are images of contemplation. I see my former
professor too; he is young, the dawn of the present's grey hair still on the
unforeseeable horizon, and I am reminded of his soft-spoken, deliberate words,
his liberal smiles. Here in these images is an ethos, a generation that has had
its day. I ask: where has the time gone? A day will come when my own present,
captured in its 4K ultra-high definition, its 60 FPS videos, its surround
sound, will seem the same way the image my former professor does to me.

Why am I consistently struck by images like these? They check me and my
obsessions, my principles and remorseless ventures, my defiances and rages, my
deep subversion and antipathy, my irreverence and disregard, my high
expectation, my absurdism  which proclaims with all its bared conviction the
active pursuit of personal meaning, hinged on individualism and suffering. Who
can't revel when resources abound, when surplus is assured? Who can't lounge at
the resort, the tropical vacation, under the canopy of a beach umbrella? How
can you measure a man's worth without plunging him into confusion, without
testing his willpower, without questioning his premises, without first casting
him into continual self-doubt, without subjecting him to arduous probing,
without seeing what comes of him at the end, without the final analysis? How
can you understand him if you only broach the surface? Does not our brittle
sentience oblige us to something higher? Begin thus: shut the eyes, lock the
world out, and create your own. There is naive happiness: contagiously
distracting, wholly irrelevant, easy happiness. And yet is joy and elation not
written in the eyes in those photos, snapshots of once-luminous years now laid
to rest, encrusted in digitized stone? What justifies this morbid
preoccupation, this pathological vexation? Who wanders on the distant shore?
There is immortality, transcendence, a surge for meaning, the soaring spirit,
and what but a mere few decades collapses a firestorm into flickering vestiges,
a reality no longer ignorable, a whirling intensity and dire flame abated by
universal inevitability? Push enough in one direction, and the path converges
on the other end, the whole ordeal turning out to be nothing more than a simple
circle. Is not man waking contradiction, lucid paradox? What lies in the
periphery erodes, our own constructions crumbling away when we, at our silent,
inconsequential ends, rejoin the dust clouds. I remember the broad strokes of
an algorithm book's preface I chanced upon some years ago, encapsulated in
these words: "We are all born into this world grasping for comprehension. We
leave it in much the same way." As I gaze at these photos and am forced to
confront the fate of our collective humanity, I cave in to the flash of
overwhelming sympathy, inspired to the depths towards pure union, and am
convinced that this is the veritable truth, but do I not soon regain the call
to existence? Am I not at every moment of ease restless? And when among friends
at an evening gathering, among companions enjoying company, am I not suspicious
of communal comfort, and am I not asking myself whether I shouldn't be doing
something productive? Perhaps I do not see past youthful illusion, and I remain
the perpetual sourpuss, the unyielding killjoy. Perhaps the matter of fact is
this habit of mine is needless exertion, because—you, me, and everyone
else—we're all just wasting time. A part of me, down to its very blood and
bones, its beating heart and spiritual core, longs for transcendence. Another,
which surfaces infrequently, and always with cataclysmic delirium, crumbles
down to earth, groveling on its knees, defeated and repenting. In me are
disjoint visions, distal opposites, a fervent intensity which hardly anyone can
detect beneath a serene appearance and pliable demeanor, much less for a people
known far more for amenability than audacity, the orient's deep-rooted harmony,
because the strength of the outward thrust is paired with a stronger restraint,
dimpled by over-sensitive nerves quickly overwhelmed from multiple commotion.

I had come across the archive photos a while ago but was reminded of them after
I was, in the unpredicatable network of the internet, linked to the late Jack
Schwartz's In Memoriam site. Browsing the photos, I felt grounded, anchored.
The fact that the camera is not as sharp as contemporary ones dates the photos,
contextualizing them. Though I never met Jack, I saw in these images a life in
retrospect, countries I've also visited, travels I can relate to, and which, as
they appear in those images, seem to belong to Jack's time. To linger over the
past is an undiluted view—somber, yes—but it is a fate which not too far in the
future will be our own and which should evoke in us not only relation to
another time and how we are situated against it, but also emphasize what is at
stake when we live ours. The greatest divides are the boundaries across
generations, life experience locked away in the written word or the still
photograph.

<h4>2019-09-30, 一. Towards Mundanity.</h4>
It seems to me that there is a misplaced importance in the glittery and special,
the infrequent and towering. Consider for a minute what we deem noteworthy, the
occasions, the people, the excursions we wish to record in some form so we may
later remember the original instance. Imagine what tempts us to take a photo:
family reunions, smiles at the museum next to Starry Night, a friend's birthday
party, a beached whale, scuba diving in the lagoon, gazing outwards at the
dappled skyscraper lights in the twilight cityscape from the top of the Empire
State Building. Imagine what we write about: intrigue, mystery, cataclysm,
swashbuckling drama, romance, adventure, fantasy, conjured fiction. The objects
and events which atract our remembrances are not those that embody our lived
experience which bears the bulk of our hours and days but which are instead the
rogue anomalies, sparkling and fanciful yet sparse and detached, unrealistic
and unrepresentative. Why is it that we pay almost exclusive attention to those
infrequent moments and overlook what occupies the bulk of our daily lives, the
very things that go unnoticed for the simple fact that the evening commute, the
season's pantry selections, the foible during Wednesday's thunderstorm, the
arrangement of books, papers, furnishings in the apartment, the brittle morning
quietude, are common and invariant? These elements of our present context, the
details of our facticity, should be cherished and appreciated precisely because
we tend not to see them, and we cannot see their value when we've acclimated to
the certainty of their presence in the periphery because they acquire contrast
and nostalgic meaning only in the years afterwards when the familiarity and
habituated motions we had once taken for granted which had, without thought,
colored our backgrounds are no longer accessible beyond vague and, by then,
certainly distorted memory, in those moments when we long that time also flows
backwards.

To each his own chosen delights and dissipation. What is revolting is when
natural complexity is buried by a pacifying smile which disregards and
invalidates these indispensible considerations, banishing them to nonexistence.
Mundane and common, yes, though nothing less than an appetite for the taste of
existence, melancholic and transient.

<h4>2019-09-29, 日.</h4>
There is a pond outside, wavelings rippling across the surface, a soft, gentle,
constant wind billowing over its still mass. Two adolescent geese are floating
near the edge, wings folded, necks tall and curved like cranes, feathered
chests thrust out like a hen sitting on her eggs, enticing to the hands like a
pomeranian's coat. It is a cloudy afternoon, a uniform grey pall, bleak and
gloom looming in the skies above, time seemingly halted, the movements of the
guiding lights in abeyance, left without an announcement when late afternoon
becomes early evening. Perhaps it is the changing of the seasons. A mild chill
this morning, headwind of the winter ahead.

<br>

<h4>2019-09-28, 六.</h4>
I am sitting in the driver's seat. My mind is frazzled, in disarray, inklings of
flickering thoughts branching in remorseless rampance, so many, so variable,
too disorganized to pursue. A sense of loss. I am driving down Douglas Road,
stuck in unusual traffic, behind an SUV stopped by a red light. I pause, shut
my eyes, take advantage of the sterile moment, hoping to quell my racing
thoughts again, this time once and for all. I had been catching up with myself
all day, tracing the lingering images, inspirations, encounters of the week
which had not yet been given due time, the weekend a reprieve from the
barbarous class schedule, being tossed between buildings and classrooms,
littered with hectic meetings, to-do lists, chaos, fragmented attention. And I
had been telling myself that even on the weekend I shouldn't lapse into rest,
letting myself loosen up and breathe, that instead I should be working. I am,
after all, in graduate school. Isn't that what I moved here for, the busyness,
the urgently packed miscellanea of academic life, a new start? When the SUV
starts moving, I realize why the road is crowded: it must be football weekend.
I am on my way to J's dinner which the day before I resolved not to attend,
then considered, re-considered, settled, uprooted, a whole series of
vacillations so typical of my character, demanding routine and predictability
yet given to sudden whims and unexpected routs. My thoughts are unstable, and I
am weary from the day's brooding and pacing, the torrent unleashed by the
weekend's dam opening the floodgates of accumulated mental weight, and pursuing
each trace is tiring, a private preoccupation, the weekend in the apartment a
furnace of dilemma and quandary, sinking into contemplation after which there
is no concretized proof of progress but which leaves me relieved and in touch
with myself, a weekly rite of passage. I fret at a question that seems to come
easily to others and which is answered just as readily, in what to them is a
natural wave of the hand and which has never occurred to me as a simple
inquiry, not because I do not wish to reply, but simply because I do not know
how to answer in a way that satisfies me, much less in the immediacy of casual
small-talk: how was my weekend? What may strike others as unfruitful,
uneventful, wallowing, unhealthy, and invented difficulty are what permeate the
time I have on my own, my home life, which is difficult not only because it
does not lend itself to communication and relatability, but also because it is
ethereal, lost even to myself unless I write these ruminations down. This is, I
suppose, what defines my home life, my little adventures: unpalatable
difficulty. But isn't this my default state? To step outside and mingle is
easy, comforting, relaxing, but I cannot help but be wary of its draws towards
complacence, deceptive alleviation, able to stroll in contentment for it has
side-stepped the obligatory uncertainty which, without the forces of disguising
compliance, lies in the plain. Plagued by unfinished strands of thought, an
octopus' arms flailing about, unbeknownst to anyone as always behind my serene
demeanor, I had forced myself to step out the apartment for dinner. I am
driving down a road, half-baked in the head, half-delirious, precarious in my
habits, not fully re-integrated with reality which I usually re-encounter on
Monday but which I can cope with because I know it in advance as a matter of
weekly routine. The laws of nature are difficult, but so is the human psyche.
If this private, continual journey delves further and further inwards, it is in
pursuit of eventual self-discovery. We are each of us, if given proper
consideration, our own worlds waiting to be unveiled.

<h4>2019-09-23, 一. Excerpt from the little black book.</h4>
Even the presence of company somehow siphons my energy. How can this be? It is
enervating, debilitating, constraining, as if my creative latitude has
contracted, my exploratory freedom diminished. A sense of companionship gives
me at once the comfort of belonging to a group but also a group's conforming
tendencies and impulses in which my instincts are muted, not permitted to
stretch. The conversations that come closest to satisfaction are with only one
other, when I can probe deeply, one-on-one, free from a group's desultory whims
and intrusive, distracting, irrelevant itches and bouts, the inevitable
trajectory of any social engagement, yet as I am walking to class with J, as I
am sitting beside her in the lecture hall, I feel unable to be fully myself, to
linger on my doubts and uncertainties, instead irremediably exuding a calm
masquerade, putting off equanimity and poise, obeying societal prodding due to
internal proclivities I've come to realize have not entirely eroded during the
course of my asocial years but which have been lying dormant and are
resurfacing beyond my will, when the state  of affairs is that I am turbulent,
restless, excitable, and in dire need of the independence availed by solitary
work. After an accompanied episode, I have not only phased out of touch with my
internal state, having lost track of my private compass, having left my
cloistered ecosystem unattended for an interrupting duration, a black chasm
gapingly torn open, almost an unknown void between the moment I was last aware
of myself and my present disorientation, whose back-filling demands
recalibration and reflection, but I am also fatigued, aghast that my redoubled
effort at socialization competes with my very nature.

I like firm showerheads with delightful pressure, no-sugar-added cheesecake,
unscented handsoap, pens that don't smear my hand's belly as it slides across
the page, pleasant saxophonists lighting up the subway with jazzy melodies,
dark humor, deep conversation, lightweight banter, naughter sarcasm, vulnerable
confessions, playful teasing, spending time sharing strange stories, mistakes
made, lingering and unresolved grievances, revealing and then laughing,
remaining sincere and faithful to the layered nuances of living, breathing, and
feeling.

I've been told on multiple occasions I look like a student. People notice it,
though it's not true. It seems that I give off the impression that I'm younger
than my years. Recently at the post office I was asked, by a cashier with
greying hair and a suspicious hesitation gleaming from his eyes, how old I was.
Sometimes the waitress at the bar cards me, because my charming youth unsettles
even the general appearance of maturity from amongst a group of exclusively
older friends, none of them less than half a decade my senior, who had all
already ordered and all without provoking the matron's protective instinct. I
was once reading diligently in the park when a woman, despite my ostensibly
studious posture nonetheless insisted on striking up a conversation, promptly
asked whether I'm a high school student, and I later had to convince myself
that it was not my choice of reading, whose cover was conveniently hidden in
its seated prostration on my lap, but whose hefty size could only have
indicated otherwise, that suggested the question. Also in recent memory is a
treasure hunt for the UPS drop box at the Presbyterian Hospital on 68th, the
sole option at that time in the evening still open for services that was also
reasonably close by, when I, in my youthful impatience, could not wait until
the following day to ship a package. It seems those hospital folk don't ship
packages often because their directions to some secluded hallway in the
basement must've been rooted in that UPS drop box's heydays when it was
formerly in demand, because it has since moved, and the basement folk, who
must've been informed of the move of such a promising and cherished protégé
which had proven, in time's merciless onslaught, to not live up to anticipated
popularity and had now been cast away in disappointment to some back corner,
pointed to the nearby stairs back up to the first floor, across the corridor,
down another hallway, and, in the course of navigating so ingeniously designed
a hospital, I passed the entrance lobby from which I arrived, coming full
circle, realizing that the two directions were hopelessly misaligned, and in
the ensuing flurry in search of the holy land, the secret sanctum, the yogi's
peace, nirvana in a box, it slowly dawned on me that, really, no one knew where
the UPS drop-off was. Or, perhaps more accurately, they were simply directing
this little, uncomprehending youth in meandering circles, round and about,
until he gave up on his own accord, the hospital masterminds acting as one,
collectively and telepathically amusing themselves with their devious tricks
and medical humor, because who but a malicious miscreant with hidden motives
shows up at the hospital so late at night and with nothing better to do than to
drop off a dainty cardboard box— who knows what's in there and what he plans to
do? Long story short, the UPS box is indeed in the basement, but cloistered at
the flank of the cafeteria known as the Garden Cafe—maybe the eponymous garden
is no measly, nameless garden of harmless shrubs and idle tulips, but rather a
minefield of treacherous strife, a religious rite of passage, the Garden of
Eden lost, corrupted, blighted, and man, searching for his return to bliss,
must navigate its deadly swamps under the guise of heartwarming food that lull
the senses with its lunchtime decor. I stood by the doors at the cafe's
entrance, evaluating the danger, thinking, this garden must be the last
obstacle, the final precipice, the most trying test. Needless to say, this is
where many a sailor who, weary and exhausted from sailing the unforgiving high
seas, the mind-bogging and labyrinthine hospital, content themselves with an
easy, filling meal, call it a day, and turn their backs on their original noble
mission. But not this seasoned sailor. To reach the fabled treasure trove, I
bolted into a Rocky-dash up a flight of stairs with exactly four steps,
pummeled past twin doors with no comforting EXIT sign in red neon above—there's
no exit in this one—actually there might have been but at that moment I was at
the height of my powers, a car on seventh gear, too focused to divert my
attention on anything but the end goal, so let's go with the story—and, as if
by intuited scent, made an immediate sharp left, and there it was: the storied
UPS box, hugging the wall, next to its second cousin the Fedex box, in a messy
bed of cardboard dangling on the floor. I found myself in the middle of a dimly
lit hall, and I glanced quickly both ways, left then right, then left again to
eye my proper reward, the haloed UPS offshoot, and I saw in this hall a ghostly
post-apocalyptic world just a door beyond, as silent and harrowing as the two
abandoned blue-leathered stretchers standing in the background, with only each
other for company in their dilapidated, forgotten, eternal melancholy, an early
image of the end to come. Anyways, back to the reason I brought this story up:
one of the security guards I inquired on my adventure was a young lass, late
twenties at most, who at the end of our encounter made a note of appending the
endearing label of "darling" to "have a good evening", the sort of diminutive
affection that one adult would not share with another, particularly with a
stranger, particularly from a lady when the stranger is a grown man, but only
with someone deemed juvenile and adolescent, and I, walking away, wondered if
it was my demure, solicitous earnesty that reminded her of a child holding out
his hands, pleading for his allowance, and provoked her to reveal, as she saw
it, the state of affairs. I deserve the credit of my years! I've weathered a
quarter of a century! That's hard work!

In my field, there's a concentration of analytical, rational, and fiercely
logical types, which I supposes in only fitting, considering this line of work,
and though I can spar toe-to-toe with my coworkers, I frequently find myself
left unsatisfied with the interactions, that though tasks a, b, and c may be
completed double-quick, I have a lingering malaise nudging at my insides, as if
I'm missing something I can't exactly pinpoint, as if moving rapidly through
to-do lists and completing the day's tasks is not quite enough. So while my
colleagues may no sooner remove the last item off their stack than they fling
themselves wholly to another concrete pursuit, I am almost always dawdling
behind, wondering in a trance about this strange incompleteness and, in brief
intervals, why I feel this way. I've grown fairly accustomed to this feeling by
now, and I think I know the reason: deep down I have a yearning that life is
not simply a procession of successive objectives, bullet points, and graspable
actions, because there's a greater satisfaction in touching a dimension beyond
the fabric of physical existence. I get this feeling sometimes too at the movie
theatre when the credits roll, and you hear the sound of those cinema seats
springing back to their upright positions, the audience emptying out, and I
remain seated, gazing at the twilight finale. I used to get it too in school,
when class ends and everyone is rushing to depart, and I'd think, isn't it a
wonder that just a minute ago the room was filled with eager youth, that only a
moment's passing as quick as the flip of a coin can so transform a room from
brimming, untamable energy to nostalgic quietude, that even now the chairs are
still warm. I don't think many of my colleagues will appreciate one of my
strange ruminations—listen: water droplets at the faucet are slowly dripping
into the wash basin!

Maybe I'm just coming up with excuses for my habitual daydreaming, though I
insist that I have a preoccupation with transcendence. You'll understand if the
following excerpt from Pablo Neruda's CON ELLA (WITH HER) unsuspectingly
disarms you, sends you to the clouds for the brief moments you're reading it,
and you stop in your tracks, seized by its beckoning call:

-In the original Spanish:

Como es duro este tiempo, espérame:<br>
vamos a vivirlo con ganas<br>
Dame tu pequeña mano:<br>
vamos a subir y sufrir<br>
vamos a sentir y saltar

-In English:

This time is difficult. Wait for me.<br>
We will live it out vividly.<br>
Give me your small hand:<br>
we will rise and suffer<br>
we will feel, we will fly
