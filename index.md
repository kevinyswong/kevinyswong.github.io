<h2>Ruminations</h2>

<h4>2023-06-22, 四. Some Thoughts on the Value of the Novel in the Twenty-first Century.</h4>
Today's post is a collection of thoughts that have occurred to me at one point
or another, some ideas and some questions I've considered, many of which I have
not quite answered.

The starting point is this question: why should someone read a novel given that
modernity offers many other sources of pleasure? The basis for this question
stems from the very real fact that we are all mortal, with finite timelines,
and so we are each posed, consciously or not, with a question: what to occupy
this timeline with? This question comes in the broad, abstract form of
ideation, in planning for the future, of reconciling with the past, but also in
the momentary decisions one makes as one goes through one's day. Within this
context, the initial question arises again: why should one read a novel? The
amount of time spent reading a novel could instead be allocated to any
alternative, to any competing call for attention, for one's finite time. The
immediate competitors to the novel are: streaming television and film,
podcasts, natural language AI, yet this problem extends as well to non-verbal
mediums: music, concerts and music festivals, theatre, concert dance, or more
casual activities like catching up with a friend or meeting someone at a bar
who has his or her own story which has the benefit of being real, not generated
by someone's faulty imagination, or even some wholesome outdoors activity, or
succumbing to the ever-distracting presence of social media. Reading a novel is
incredibly impractical because it yields no material gain, no apparent benefit.
Why should someone picking up a book, scrutinizing the pretty cover and
skimming the summary and reviews on the back, assessing whether or not to buy
it, be convinced that this book won't turn out to be a complete waste of time?
It would hardly surprise anyone that literary readership has been declining
over the years, as we shall we further below.

To be clear, I am not saying that one should pick one activity to the exclusion
of others, but that within one's lifetime, one is going to dabble in these
various activities—and when it comes to enjoying things like novels, films, and
music, readily accessible in the modern age, why settle for anything less than
the best? Even the most avid reader is limited in how many books he or she can
read in a lifetime. So then why pick this novel and not the one next to it on
the shelf, or any other in the library or bookstore? Why read this author and
not any other? Indeed, if one is a novelist, how can one know what one writes
is not derivative or repetitive, not a mere echo of another novel which is
already available at the nearest bookstore, or that what he writes will remain
relevant in ten, twenty years? What new insights or ideas does this novel
provide that hasn't already been said? How can a novelist be certain he is not
an imbecile peddling egotism, proclaiming that his narrative is worth more
attention than others, forgetting that everyone else also has a story and can
also use words? I suppose it's a form of naivety or an arrogant ego to put out
a novel and expect anyone to read it because one is asking the reader to spend
some of his or her finite time on a humble, little novel rather than on
Shakespeare or Dante or Proust or Cervantes. As Virginia Woolf writes in her
essay HOW SHOULD ONE READ A BOOK?:
<blockquote>
Are they not criminals, books that have wasted our time and sympathy; are they
not the most insidious enemies of society, corrupters, defilers, the writers of
false books, faked books, books that fill the air with decay and disease? Let
us then be severe in our judgments; let us compare each book with the greatest
of its kind . . . And we may be sure that the newness of new poetry and fiction
is its most superficial quality and that we have only to alter slightly, not to
recast, the standards by which we have judged the old.
</blockquote>

If the conventional wisdom is that Americans at present are reading fewer books
than earlier generations, how many people are still reading? I wish to start by
mentioning a strange phenomenon: book sales, at least in recent years, are not
declining. WordsRated
<a href="https://wordsrated.com/book-sales-statistics/#:~:text=As%20of%202022%2C%20over%20788,the%20US%20in%20one%20year">charted</a>
how many printed books sold in the U.S. between 2018 and 2022, and the trend is
not that book sales are definitively dropping, but that sales have been more or
less consistent, rising some years and lowering in others, hovering around 750
million sold per year. Yet according to a Gallup
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388541/americans-reading-fewer-books-past.aspx">article</a>
with data from 1990 to 2021, Americans are indeed reading fewer books—though
according to this poll the decline is not precipitous, only lowering from an
average of 15.3 in 1990 to 12.6 in 2021. The caveat, though, is that both of
these numbers are generously high—the question Gallup used was an umbrella
catch-all for "how many books [Americans] 'read, either all or part of the way
through'", and these numbers are not limited to printed books, but "all forms
of books, including printed books but also electronic books and audiobooks."
The Gallup poll notes that this drop is not due to a broad drop in book
readership across the population, but due primarily to a drop among avid
readers: "The decline in book reading is mostly a function of how many books
readers are reading, as opposed to fewer Americans reading any books . . . The
drop is fueled by a decline in the percentage of Americans reading more than 10
books in the past year." Yet Caleb Crain came to the opposite conclusion in an
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-we-dont-read-revisited">article</a>
in The New Yorker: "[T]he average reading time of all Americans declined not
because readers read less but because fewer people were reading at all, a
proportion falling from 26.3 per cent of the population in 2003 to 19.5 per
cent in 2016. You could call this a compositional effect, but it's a rather
tautological one: reading is in decline because the population is now composed
of fewer readers." This variance may be due to their different data collection
methods; Gallup surveyed 811 participants by asking them over the phone how
many books they read in the past year, while Crain, writing that, "It's pretty
much useless to ask how many books somebody read last year, because almost
nobody remembers, and many exaggerate, to seem smarter", used the annual
<a href="https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/TUU10101AA01006315;jsessionid=81D5747AEC421B2F66366EE6E20CA82B">data</a>
since 2003 from the American Time Use Survey, which
<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/atus.html">asks</a>
participants "to recall how [they] spent [their] time during the 24-hour period
on the day before [their] interview." However, even this method isn't perfect,
as Crain writes, "A subject who doesn't report any reading may not be a
non-reader in any absolute sense. All we know for sure is that she didn't
happen to do any reading on the day under scrutiny." Yet whatever the reason is
for the diminishing readership numbers, this seems to be the consensus: book
readership is on the decline. But why are book sales not matching that decline,
that books are still selling fairly well even though fewer Americans are
actually reading? LitHub points out this
<a href="https://lithub.com/americans-are-buying-more-books-but-reading-fewer-of-them-than-ever-what-gives/">anomaly</a>,
noting the book sales data from the Gallup poll above, then mentioning, "In
fact, these days Americans are reading less than they have in over 30
years . . . So what's going on here? Why are Americans buying more books, but
actually reading fewer of them?" The article suggests some possible reasons,
then lists some from their Slack channel, including a facetious comment, "books
are only for taking photos of and posting to Instagram, not for reading,
silly." And if that's one reason, who am I to judge? Perhaps
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rahhbn0AAAAJ&hl=en">Erving Goffman</a>
was right in 1956 when he wrote in THE PRESENTATION OF THE SELF IN EVERYDAY LIFE
that:
<blockquote>
[A] Vogue model, by her clothing, stance, and facial expression, is able
expressively to portray a cultivated understanding of the book she poses in her
hand; but those who trouble to express themselves so appropriately will have
very little time left over for reading . . . And so individuals often find
themselves with the dilemma of expression versus action. Those who have the
time to perform a task well may not, because of this, have the time or talent
to make it apparent that they are performing well. It may be said that some
organizations resolve this dilemma by officially delegating the dramatic
function to a specialist who will spend his time expressing the meaning of the
task and spend no time actually doing it.
</blockquote>

Again, I'm not judging; it's other people's lives, which is none of my business.
I'm merely making an observation, suggesting it as perhaps a problem for
novelists, one that should be addressed, and even then, it's not that I have
any more than vague ideas moving forward. Whether or not people end up read the
books they buy, the most popular books are starting to get self-conscious about
saving the trees: according to an
<a href="https://wordsrated.com/bestselling-books-have-never-been-shorter/">analysis</a>
by WordsRated, New York Times bestsellers have been getting shorter,
decreasing "by 51.5 pages from 2011 to 2021, from 437.5 to 386 (11.8%)." And
what is the scope of the population that doesn't read? According to the Gallup
poll, which uses the loose definition of reading as consuming in part or in
whole any book form, 17% of Americans don't read at all, "a percentage that has
held steady" between 1990 and 2021. This consistency is mirrored in a
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/09/21/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">survey</a>
from The Pew Research Center which uses same loose definition of reading as
Gallup; the percentage itself is different, but the trend is the same: "The 23%
of adults who currently say they have not read any books in the past year is
identical to the share who said this in 2014." In a stricter conception of
reading by WordsRated—which is obviously a research group that takes itself
very seriously—oh, so serious!—defined as finishing a full book either in
printed or ebook form, 51.57% of Americans have not read a single book in the
past 12 months in a 2022
<a href="https://wordsrated.com/american-reading-habits-study/">study</a>—maybe
the folks in this survey weren't trying to seem smarter, perhaps because they,
like WordsRated, take themselves very seriously.

What are the costs of declining book readership? The National Endowment for the
Arts issued in 2002 a
<a href="https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/ReadingAtRisk.pdf">report</a>
called, menacingly, READING AT RISK, using data collected by the Census Bureau
at three points over the course of twenty years—in 1982, 1992, and 2002—to show
the decline in literary reading, with the percentage of adults reading dropping
from 56.9% to 54% to 46.7%. The report cautions:
<blockquote>
While oral culture has a rich immediacy that is not to be dismissed, and
electronic media offer the considerable advantages of diversity and access,
print culture affords irreplaceable forms of focused attention and
contemplation that make complex communications and insights possible. To lose
such intellectual capability – and the many sorts of human continuity it
allows – would constitute a vast cultural impoverishment. More than reading is
at stake. As this report unambiguously demonstrates, readers play a more active
and involved role in their communities. The decline in reading, therefore,
parallels a larger retreat from participation in civic and cultural life. The
long-term implications of this study not only affect literature but all the
arts – as well as social activities such as volunteerism, philanthropy, and
even political engagement.
</blockquote>

—in short: The sky is falling! And so on. As the report suggests, there may
indeed be a correlation between reading and participation the activities
in "civic and cultural life," because their data "shows the levels
of 'crossover' participation, that is, the number of literary readers who also
participate in a range of additional cultural and leisure activities." According
to the report:
<blockquote>
Analysis of the . . . data . . .  show that people who read literature are
active, attending a variety of arts events, volunteering in their communities,
and participating in sports. In fact, literary readers are much more likely to
participate than those who do not read. For example, literary readers are
nearly three times as likely to attend a performing arts event, almost four
times as likely to visit an art museum, over two-and-a-half times as likely to
do volunteer or charity work, over one-and-a-half times as likely to attend
sporting events, and over one-and-a-half times as likely to participate in
sports activities. In fact, people who read larger numbers of books tend to
have the highest levels of participation in other activities, especially arts
activities.
</blockquote>

The crossover effect may not be as dramatic as the report suggests. The report's
tables do show that readers engage significantly more in those other
activities, but correlations are not causations: more educated and more
affluent folks, as the report points out as well, read more. They would also
participate in those other activities at higher rates.

Another possible cost of declining book readership: a 2016
<a href="https://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/ijba/article/view/9481/5736">paper</a>
on graduate business students found a correlation between the complexity of
students' reading with that of their writing:
<blockquote>
Our findings reveal strong correlations between students' most common reading
content and their writing on widely-used measures of writing
sophistication . . . Students who read academic journals, 'literary' fiction,
or general non-fiction wrote with greater syntactic sophistication than
students who read genre fiction (mysteries, fantasy, or science fiction) or
exclusively web-based content aggregators like Reddit, Tumblr, and BuzzFeed. In
fact, when we examined the scores on L2 measures of syntactic complexity,
writing with the lowest syntactic complexity was associated with heavy or
exclusive reading of web-based content from the likes of BuzzFeed, Tumblr, and
Reddit. In contrast, students with the highest scores of syntactic complexity
in their writing read academic journals more frequently than their peers . . .
In particular, our ability to read and write involves Broca's area, which
enables us to perceive rhythm and syntax; Wernicke's area, which impacts our
perception of words and meaning; and the angular gyrus, central to our
perception and use of language. In addition, Broca's and Wernicke's areas are
wired together by a band of fibres, the arcuate fasciculus, while the angular
gyrus itself sits as the junction between the occipital (visual functions) and
temporal (auditory functions) intersect. This neuroanatomy may predispose even
adults to mimicry and synchrony with the language they routinely encounter in
their reading, directly impacting their writing.
</blockquote>

Neuroplasticity, as Nicholas Carr argues in THE SHALLOWS: WHAT THE INTERNET IS
DOING TO OUR BRAINS, is how our mental capacities are growing more and more
distracted, subject to superficial websurfing:
<blockquote>
Just as neurons that fire together wire together, neurons that don't fire
together don't wire together. As the time we spend scanning Web pages crowds
out the time we spend reading books, as the time we spend exchanging bite-sized
text messages crowds out the time we spend composing sentences and paragraphs,
as the time we spend hopping across links crowds out the time we devote to
quiet reflection and contemplation, the circuits that support those old
intellectual functions and pursuits weaken and begin to break apart. The brain
recycles the disused neurons and synapses for other, more pressing work. We
gain new skills and perspectives but lose old ones . . . The researchers found
that when people search the Net they exhibit a very different pattern of brain
activity than they do when they read a book-like text. Book readers have a lot
of activity in regions associated with language, memory, and visual processing,
but they don't display much activity in the prefrontal regions associated with
decision making and problem solving. Experienced Net users, by contrast,
display extensive activity across all those brain regions when they scan and
search Web pages . . . But the extensive activity in the brains of surfers also
points to why deep reading and other acts of sustained concentration become so
difficult online . . . Whenever we, as readers, come upon a link, we have to
pause, for at least a split second, to allow our prefrontal cortex to evaluate
whether or nor we should click on it . . . [Comprehension] declined as the
number of links increased. Readers were forced to devote more and more of their
attention and brain power to evaluating the links and deciding whether to click
on them.
</blockquote>

Be that as it may. I am not suggesting anyone take on the probably impossible
task of withdrawing from technology altogether and become a cave-dwelling
Luddite—the world will move on, technology will continue evolving, taking up a
greater share of our lives as we become more dependent on it, however much any
cantankerous curmudgeon complains about corrupting new technologies and
disorderly younger generations, but that it may be worthwhile to recognize the
costs and what it is that's changing. A further question: if writing levels are
declining, who's to say assistant writing software like Grammarly won't help?
Or perhaps even generative AI? Maybe at some point we will have outsourced most
of our writing to technology. An opinion
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401223000233">paper</a>
this year provokes the reader in the title: SO WHAT IF CHATGPT WROTE IT? The
paper presents a long list of precautions, biases, and limitations, concluding
with the thought that "it is imperative to enact new laws to govern these
tools." But how well can ChatGPT write an academic paper? A recent radiology
<a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.223312">article</a>
was written mostly by ChatGPT, with the author,
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=37CkqwcAAAAJ&hl=en">Som Biswas</a>,
then doing the editing. Biswas writes, perhaps not without protest by some
readers, "Herein, we see that artificial intelligence has come to a level at
par, if not above, human authors." ChatGPT itself describes how it can be used
in medical writing: "A chatbot trained on medical writing could potentially
assist a medical writer by generating draft text for a document . . . The
writer could then review and edit the generated text as needed to ensure
accuracy and clarity." Another recent
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4338981">article</a>,
from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QNM0fKIAAAAJ&hl=en">Lea Bishop</a>,
was written through a Socratic dialogue with ChatGPT, in which Bishop writes
aggressively, though with a refreshingly honest directness, in the
introduction:
<blockquote>
Your entire life experience up to this point in time is consistent with the
belief that only human beings can compose 'natural-sounding' paragraphs. . . .
Like the human evaluator proposed by Alan Turing, you were fooled. You were
unable to distinguish ChatGPT from a human being. From this day forward, you
will commonly be unable to distinguish a machine writer from a human one. This
article will help you wrestle with that strange new reality.
</blockquote>

She then adds, "And in case you were wondering, I did in fact write the second
and third paragraphs myself. You'll just have to take my word on that." If
artificial intelligence writes better than humans, we may at least no longer
have to suffer the fallibilities of unconsidered human-writing like garden-path
sentences and what Helen Sword calls zombie nouns. As
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bUhVerAAAAAJ&hl=en">Steven Pinker</a>
writes, "[F]or every ambiguity that yields a coherent (but unintended)
interpretation of the whole sentence, there must be thousands which trip up the
reader momentarily, forcing her to backtrack and re-parse a few words." And
what about longer pieces of writing? In the coming years, with improved
versions, how well can ChatGPT write a novel? Would it just need some light
editing by a human assistant? If you knew it was written by AI, would you read
it? How can you tell? What about short, comforting, saccharine snippets of
poetry? Would it matter? Would such a future be reprehensible?

Let us now take a step back and situate the declining book readership problem
within a societal context (I apologize if this section is long, as it's not the
main concern of this post, but this grew and grew as I was writing it). No one
likes to think about class or inequality; it simply is not pleasant to consider
unequal access to resources due to causes not entirely under one's control, but
its effects on book readership, among other things, are unignorable. The Pew
study above mentions:
<blockquote>
Several demographic traits are linked with not reading books, according to the
survey. For instance, adults with a high school diploma or less are far more
likely than those with a bachelor's or advanced degree to report not reading
books in any format in the past year (39% vs. 11%) . . . In addition, adults
whose annual household income is less than $30,000 are more likely than those
living in households earning $75,000 or more a year to be non-book readers
(31% vs. 15%). Hispanic adults (38%) are more likely than Black (25%) or White
adults (20%) to report not having read a book in the past 12 months.
</blockquote>

—the paragraph concludes with a sentence in parentheses: "The survey included
Asian Americans but did not have sufficient sample size to do statistical
analysis of this group."—hey, at least they tried. Crain's article in The New
Yorker links to a
<a href="https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/tny-services/photos/5b215b032acbf821b1b753f2/master/pass/readingbyincomequartile.png">line chart</a>
showing the average hours per day spent reading within each income quartile,
based on data from the American Time Use Survey, with Crain summarizing it
unsurprisingly as, "it turns out that the rich read more."

As it happens, the link between class (here, I use the terms 'class'
and 'status' colloquially and interchangeably, whereas in sociology the terms
are distinct, as Weber defined class as an objective economic position and
status as a subjective perception of social honor and prestige) and cultural
consumption has been the subject of research. I wish to preface this section
with the origin of this kind of research, because of its perpetual relevance
and also because of the incisive writing whose truth has no doubt animated,
inflamed, and penetrated no fewer than just a handful of bookish academics.
Though earlier sociologists (Durkheim, Weber) had studied social class,
empirical studies on the link between class and cultural consumption started
with
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d_lp40IAAAAJ&hl=en">Pierre Bourdieu</a>,
whose book DISTINCTION: A SOCIAL CRITIQUE OF THE JUDGMENT OF TASTE (published in
the original French in 1979 and translated into English in 1984) proposed the
concept of cultural capital, among other forms of capital, and showed that
differential preferences towards aesthetics, the arts, along with the different
ways of self-presentation, of speaking, of familiarities, are segmented along
class lines within a stratified society. Bourdieu described how the ruling
upper class sustains class distinction in part through its dominant taste that
is universally accepted in society as proper and legtimate. As Bourdieu writes:
<blockquote>
In fact, through the economic and social conditions which they presuppose, the
different ways of relating to realities and fictions, of believing in fictions
and the realities they simulate, with more or less distance and detachment, are
very closely linked to the different possible positions in social space and,
consequently, bound up with the systems of dispositions (habitus) characteristic
of the different classes and class fractions. Taste classifies, and it
classifies the classifier . . . The denial of lower, coarse, vulgar, venal,
servile—in a word, natural—enjoyment, which constitutes the sacred sphere of
culture, implies an affirmation of the superiority of those who can be
satisfied with the sublimated, refined, disinterested, gratuitous,
distinguished pleasures forever closed to the profane. That is why art and
cultural consumption are predisposed, consciously and deliberately or not, to
fulfil [sic] a social function of legitimating social differences.
</blockquote>

Bourdieu writes more specifically:
<blockquote>
It must never be forgotten that the working-class 'aesthetic' is a dominated
'aesthetic' which is constantly obliged to define itself in terms of the
dominant aesthetics. The members of the working class, who can neither ignore
the high-art aesthetic, which denounces their own 'aesthetic', nor abandon
their socially conditioned inclinations, but still less proclaim them and
legitimate them . . .
</blockquote>

Within the research community, Bourdieu's thesis of high art and low art as
understood, appreciated, and consumed by its corresponding social class is also
called the homology argument, but in 1992 Richard Peterson and Albert Simkus
introduced an alternative model, the omnivore-univore hypothesis, based on
their
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VHMhOCNyQ-kC&oi=fnd&pg=PA152&dq=peterson+simkus+omnivore&ots=hIZIHcHgMJ&sig=ZB3YcMwTjAr1H2-jfILfKF4-L-g#v=onepage&q&f=false">study</a>
of musical taste among status groups. According to the paper:
<blockquote>
There is mounting evidence that high-status groups not only participate more
than others do in high-status activites but also tend to participate more often
in most kinds of leisure activities. In effect, elite taste is no longer
defined as an expressed appreciation of the high art forms . . . Now it is
being redefined as an appreciation of the aesthetics of every distinctive form
along with an appreciation of the high arts.
</blockquote>
Peterson published another
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304422X9290008Q">paper</a>
on the subject the same year, developing it further a few years later,
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096460">proposing</a>
"a qualitative shift in the basis for marking elite status—from snobbish
exclusion to omnivorous appropriation." It seems that the omnivore-univore
model has gained acceptance as the prevailing representation, as suggested by
this
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X07000186">paper</a>
and the ones I'll mention below which build on the omnivore view. With this new
representation, as we shall see, some details have changed, but the underlying
motivation remains. As
<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=gZYGfFAAAAAJ&hl=en">Jerome Barkow</a>
writes in a 1975
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2741630">paper</a>:
<blockquote>
Whenever anthropologists discuss competition and jealousy, speak of potlatches
or counting coups, describe displays of ritualized boasting and ostentation or
even the emergence of social stratification, they are making a basic
assumption: men seek prestige and status, deference and respect. Such an
assumption calls not for challenge—there is no reason to suspect its
validity—but for analysis.
</blockquote>

Who are these cultural omnivores? According to Peterson, the traditional
highbrow exclusives have been replaced by these open, inclusive, accepting,
egalitarian elites. But do these new elites harbor any desire for distinction?
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O7OzM5wAAAAJ&hl=en">Tak Wing Chan</a>
writes in a 2019
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-4446.12613">paper</a>
seeking to answer this question:
<blockquote>
[T]here are two views on this matter. Under the first view, omnivores are
essentially tolerant, cosmopolitan individuals who are generally open to
different cultural styles. Under the second view, cultural omnivorousness is an
expression of distinction, a new form of cultural capital, and a novel way to
demonstrate cultural and social superiority.
</blockquote>

Some researchers advocate the second view, while Chan is among those who believe
in the first, writing in the paper:
<blockquote>
[T]hese results suggest that omnivorousness is an expression of cosmopolitan
postmaterialism rather than a new form of distinction . . . Having considered
the evidence . . . it seems to me that the first view receives far more
empirical support than does the second . . . [I]t would be unjustified to
regard cultural omnivorousness as the symbolic expression of class domination
or of status competition. Instead, it might be more useful to think along the
following line. Some individuals are more open, tolerant and cosmopolitan than
others.
</blockquote>

When he wrote this paper, Chan's view did not change from the initial conviction
he had 13 years prior to the paper's publication, when in an earlier
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcl016">paper</a>,
published in 2006, in which he, along with
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1FgS9pkAAAAJ&hl=en">John Goldthorpe</a>,
wrote that while "data adequate to test this possibility are not yet
available":
<blockquote>
[S]o far as our present findings go, they incline us to favour the
'self-realization' rather than the 'status competition' view . . . [W]e would
believe that a rather radical rethinking is now required of the nature of
status relations in modern societies, and likewise of the part played by
differences in cultural consumption in these relations. We would ally
ourselves with proponents of the omnivore–univore argument who claim that,
whatever validity the ideas of symbolic 'struggle' and 'violence', as advanced
by Bourdieu and his followers, may have had for the earlier history of modern
societies, they appear out of place the contemporary world. However, new ideas
are then needed. Thus, while in the case of present-day Britain, a status
order can still be discerned, it would appear to be less sharply demarcated
than previously; and there is other evidence to indicate that status
differences are now less openly asserted from above or deferentially
acknowledged from below. In turn, therefore, it could also be that the
connection between status and cultural consumption is itself tending to
weaken, and even on omnivore-univore lines.
</blockquote>

I suspect Chan has been unduly optimistic about what seems to be an
inextinguishable component of human nature. Yet in the 2019 paper (the rest of
this section on Chan's view is based on this paper, not the 2006 one), Chan
recognizes that due to public disapproval, omnivores would not admit to holding
superior tastes:
<blockquote>
[S]ince supercilious attitudes, or at least their public expression, have become
less acceptable, omnivores are unlikely to admit to feeling superior to others.
Moreover, they might not be fully aware of the status motivations that drive
their cultural consumption. For these reasons, we do not have survey evidence
that would directly reveal what omnivorousness means.
</blockquote>

He then describes the reasoning that led to his conclusion:
<blockquote>
Nonetheless, it is possible to determine whether cultural omnivores have a
distinctive profile of attitudes in other domains. Such information will give
us a sense of the kind of individuals omnivores are . . . [I]f cultural
omnivorousness is, at its core, a form of distinction in the Bourdieusian
sense, then we would expect omnivores to be quite status-conscious. In
particular, when asked how they see themselves generally, i.e. outside the
context of cultural consumption, we would expect education and occupation, the
two most important status-conferring attributes to be especially salient to
cultural omnivores.
</blockquote>

I have two qualms about Chan's paper:

1) His survey data is not relevant to his question

The survey from which he obtains his data asks its respondents this question
(trimmed to only the relevant variables that happened to be the first two):

<blockquote>
We’d like to know how important various things are to your sense of who you are.
Please think about each of the following and tick the box that indicates
whether you think it is very important, fairly important, not very important or
not at all important to your sense of who you are. Please tick one answer on
each line.
<br><br>
1. Your profession?<br>
2. Your level of education?<br>
. . .
</blockquote>

Respondents fill out this survey at an arbitrary time in the course of their
day. This is my question: would those who aspire to cultural distinction and
who wish to maintain it remain aware of an attitude of superiority in every
occasion, at every waking moment, unsolicited, not triggered by an awareness in
relation to another's taste, and to such a degree that it would, just as
continuously throughout the day, spill over to their regarding their profession
and education as important? And this, by the way, would be among omnivores
whose manifest appetite is variety and inclusiveness and acceptance of those
from different backgrounds, who are additionally aware that "supercilious
attitudes, or at least their public expression, have become less acceptable."
In short, I disagree with Chan's claim that such data, obtained from omnivores
"when asked how they see themselves generally, i.e. outside the context of
cultural consumption", would be relevant to the question at hand—how omnivores
signal their distinction.

2) I disagree with his reasoning

This is his reasoning translated into a form more analyzable: placing high
importance on the self's (1) education and (2) occupation indicates
status-consciousness, and, further, this status-consciousness reveals subtle
aspiration towards cultural distinction. This is the logical progression on
which Chan bases his conclusion that omnivores are not concerned with status
competition. So if he doesn't find that omnivores place high importance on the
self's education or occupation—and in the study he doesn't—then they must not
be status-conscious about cultural distinction. Where I disagree is that the
absence of highly valuing one's education or occupation does not necessitate a
corresponding absence of status-consciousness.

To be specific: what does he do in his study? Using latent class analysis on
data of musical and visual arts consumption, he generated three latent classes:
univores, omnivores, and paucivores (whose cultural consumption is in the
modest middle between those of univores and omnivores). Then, using
this "threefold typology" as the independent variable, he does regression
analyses on 25 dependent variables, which are grouped into 7 domains, of which
only one—sense of self, which includes how much respondents value their
education and occupation—is relevant to my point, since it's the one Chan used
to lead to his conclusion that omnivores disregard cultural distinction
(he comes up with other conclusions in the paper). Chan, discovering that
omnivores don't place greater importance on their education or occupation than
univores or paucivores, leaps to the conclusion that they are not more
status-conscious and therefore do not think their "cultural omnivorousness is
an expression of distinction." It is this leap to the conclusion that I take
issue with because many affluent folks these days prefer to be inconspicuous,
don't identify with privilege, and may not think their education or occupation
particularly important. Matthew Stewart describes these folks in an article in
The Atlantic,
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/">THE 9.9 PERCENT IS THE NEW AMERICAN ARISTOCRACY</a>,
in which he writes:
<blockquote>
I've joined a new aristocracy now, even if we still call ourselves meritocratic
winners . . . To be sure, there is a lot to admire about my new group, which
I'll call—for reasons you'll soon see—the 9.9 percent. We've dropped the old
dress codes, put our faith in facts, and are (somewhat) more varied in skin
tone and ethnicity . . . It is in fact the top 0.1 percent who have been the
big winners in the growing concentration of wealth over the past half
century . . . Every piece of the pie picked up by the 0.1 percent, in relative
terms, had to come from the people below. But not everyone in the 99.9 percent
gave up a slice. Only those in the bottom 90 percent did . . . In between the
top 0.1 percent and the bottom 90 percent is a group that has been doing just
fine. It has held on to its share of a growing pie decade after decade. And as
a group, it owns substantially more wealth than do the other two combined . . .
You'll find the new aristocracy there. We are the 9.9 percent . . . So what
kind of characters are we, the 9.9 percent? We are mostly not like those
flamboyant political manipulators from the 0.1 percent. We're a well-behaved,
flannel-suited crowd of lawyers, doctors, dentists, mid-level investment
bankers, M.B.A.s with opaque job titles, and assorted other professionals—the
kind of people you might invite to dinner. In fact, we're so self-effacing, we
deny our own existence. We keep insisting that we're 'middle class.' . . . We
gaze upon the 0.1 percent with a mixture of awe, envy, and eagerness to obey.
As a consequence, we are missing the other big story of our time. We have left
the 90 percent in the dust—and we've been quietly tossing down roadblocks
behind us to make sure that they never catch up . . . In my family, Aunt Sarah
was the true believer. According to her version of reality, the family name was
handed down straight from the ancient kings of Scotland . . . The 9.9 percent
are different. We don't delude ourselves about the ancient sources of our
privilege. That's because, unlike Aunt Sarah and her imaginary princesses,
we've convinced ourselves that we don't have any privilege at all.
</blockquote>

Chan notes in his paper that other researchers believe in the opposing view,
that omnivorousness is the new marker for distinction. Because I know I have
observed the finer points of courtesy and have not been obvious, I wish to make
it known that I am also convinced of the opposing view. Chan acknowledges these
other researchers in his paper (to adapt this quote from an academic paper to
an internet page, I've taken out the year of publication and page numbers and
added the link to the referred paper/book):
<blockquote>
Ollivier
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X08000077">asserts</a>
that omnivorousness is "the new 'aesthetics of elite status' which replaced
highbrow snobbishness as a means of class distinction." She maintains that it
is 'a new form of cultural capital, in the Bourdieusian sense'. Warde et al.
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X08000065">see</a>
'more than a hint that in Britain an omnivorous orientation is itself a way
of negotiating and demonstrating a form of distinction.' In a study of an elite
boarding school in America, Khan
<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691156231/privilege">posits</a>
that omnivorous consumption 'is itself a symbolic marker . . . this
omnivorousness, become their own mark of distinction.' Similarly, Coulangeon
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1749975516680518">argues</a>
that the '[c]ultural privilege of the elite [in France] seems to be increasingly
defined by the combination of involvement in highbrow culture with openness to
cultural diversity . . . it also goes hand in hand with a kind of
self-segregation of the elite which is not fully consistent with the concept of
cosmopolitanism . . . openness to cultural otherness is not incompatible with
distance from the others.'
</blockquote>

To add more context, I wish to add a few more words from first two papers in the
above paragraph. Michèle Ollivier writes:
<blockquote>
Openness to cultural diversity, I argue, represents a new aesthetics and a new
ethos, but it builds upon, rather than displaces, the older categories of high
and mass culture in which it remains thoroughly embedded. Far from being
dismantled, social and artistic hierarchies are being reconfigured in more
individualized ways. Modes of openness rest on different models of agency which
are themselves hierarchized along class and gender lines.
</blockquote>

And
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9N0Au5kAAAAJ&hl=en">Alan Warde</a>
et al.:
<blockquote>
[W]hilst there is strong evidence of a decline in overt snobbishness in the UK,
there is also evidence that omnivores have a more intensive involvement
with ‘legitimate’ culture which goes alongside a selective appropriation of
popular culture. In particular their dislikes reveal limits to openness which
imply, paradoxically, a role for an omnivorous orientation in processes of
distinction.
</blockquote>

I wish to present the findings of a few researchers on the question of whether
omnivorousness connotes an implicit status signal. Warde et al. also (the same
authors as the above paper)
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1749975507078185?journalCode=cusa">write</a>
in a paper published in the year prior that although omnivores are more
tolerant, their broad appetite may in fact be the new status signal:
<blockquote>
The evidence of our interviews is certainly that omnivorousness accompanies
tolerance; there was no evidence of the drawing of cultural boundaries to
exclude other social groups, and few indications of snobbishness when
expressing personal cultural tastes. Yet at the same time, extensive engagement
is probably now considered a marker of good taste . . . Most studies which have
compared the patterns of participation of omnivores with those of more
traditional fine arts audiences, have found that omnivores attend theatre,
opera, classical concerts, etc. more than do those who restrict their
activities to high culture. Competence in consecrated culture remains
restricted to a limited segment of the middle class. That segment may now have
wider tastes in addition, but command of consecrated culture remains a token of
distinction which probably still operates effectively as a form of cultural
capital.
</blockquote>

A
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2009.01880.x">paper</a>
from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mqiacvcAAAAJ&hl=en">Gindo Tampubolon</a>
provides an analysis that
<blockquote>
raise[s] questions about the omnivore-univore thesis and existing literature on
cultural consumption. The findings also show that contrary to some recent
studies, cultural consumption continues to be structured by social class. Most
intriguing, however, is the result that culture is seen by avid cultural
omnivores to be hierarchical. The received understanding of omnivores as
tolerant and possessing inclusive tastes across culture hierarchy . . .
diverges from evidence of both division within and culture hierarchy perceived
by the omnivores. The apparent divergence can be resolved by acknowledging that
the concept of omnivores as those whose tastes are inclusive pre-supposes and
guarantees the existence of culture hierarchy.

from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l8aM4jAAAAAJ&hl=en">Gerbert Kraaykamp</a>
et al. is interesting because it distinguishes omnivores from highbrows
exclusives, examining
<blockquote>
class and status effects on specific cultural activities as well as on patterns
of cultural consumption by distinguishing four types of cultural consumer:
omnivores, highbrows, univores and inactives.
</blockquote>

And how are omnivores and highbrows different? The authors write:
<blockquote>
Both of these taste patterns include highbrow culture, but the omnivore pattern
is argued to be on the rise as new way to signal status, while the numbers of
highbrow exclusivists are thought to be diminishing . . . The results . . .
suggest that there is no status difference between cultural omnivores and
highbrow 'snobs' . . . Engaging in popular culture as a highbrow participant
does not seem to harm one's status, indicating that the omnivore taste patterns
is by all means respectable, and even preferred among younger generations with
ample economic resources who live in urban areas with generous cultural
infrastructure.
</blockquote>

The paper notes that:
<blockquote>
the effects of class and status are strongest for highbrow activities. These
are still very much socially stratified, thus contradicting bold arguments that
class or status has become irrelevant for taste formation.
</blockquote>

A
<a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/coso/12/2/article-p160_2.xml?language=en">paper</a>
from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qgZ7mMkAAAAJ&hl=en">Jürgen Gerhards</a>
et al.
examining the relation between class membership and highbrow consumption in 27
European countries found that, "In all of the countries considered, highbrow
consumption is afffected by class position. Highbrow activities are typical
among the upper social classes and form an essential part of a distinguished
lifestyle." However, the paper also highlights the possibility of greater
access: "Growing societal prosperity and increasing education, however, have
two consequences: First, they enable a larger proportion of the population to
participate in highbrow consumption. Second, these factors decrease the shaping
influence of social class on highbrow lifestyles."

But what is different about highbrow culture so that only the educated consume
it? Kraaykamp et al.'s paper above notes that:
<blockquote>
As highbrow culture is often complex, innovative and/or experimental, specific
competencies are needed to enjoy and comprehend it. Several scholars, however,
also argue that aspects of prestige and honour are associated with the
consumption of highbrow culture . . . The act of consuming cultural events may
be perceived as a group-specific token to signal a certain status position to
the outside world . . . In that respect, decisions on cultural choices often
seem to reflect status considerations. Social differentiation in cultural
tastes exists because there is mutual agreement on aesthetic standards and
values within classes or social group.
</blockquote>

Bourdieu again:
<blockquote>
The hostility of the working class and of the middle-class fractions least rich
in cultural capital towards every kind of formal experimentation asserts itself
both in the theatre and in painting, or still more clearly, because they have
less legitimacy, in photography and the cinema. In the theatre as in the
cinema, the popular audience delights in plots that proceed logically and
chronologically towards a happy end, and 'identifies' better with simply drawn
situations and characters than with ambiguous and symbolic figures and actions
or the enigmatic problems of the theatre of cruelty, not to mention the
suspended animation of Beckettian heroes or the bland absurdities of
Pinteresque dialogue. Their reluctance or refusal springs not just from lack of
familiarity but from a deep-rooted demand for participation, which formal
experiment systematically disappoints, especially when, refusing to offer
the 'vulgar' attractions of an art of illusion, the theatrical fiction
denounces itself, as in all forms of 'a play within a play.'
</blockquote>

More relevant to my original question, in a 2007
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X07000150">paper</a>,
SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND CULTURAL CONSUMPTION IN HUNGARY: BOOK READERSHIP,
<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PmfqrPoAAAAJ&hl=en">Erzsébet Bukodi</a>
examines the effects of statification specifically on book readership, writing:
<blockquote>
Results show that status, education and income are the three main bases for
stratification in book reading in this country . . . People's reading behaviour
is strongly associated both with their own and with their parents' social
status . . .  Further, only individuals at the top of the status hierarchy
possess an adequate amount of educational and financial resources to consume
the most 'canonised' forms of culture; in this case, serious literature and
work-related non-fiction texts.
</blockquote>

There's a stray case in Hungary in that it became a democratic country only
recently, in 1989, so the changes in cultural consumption patterns among status
groups can be studied. Bukodi released the same year as the paper above a
<a href="https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/6925">working paper</a>,
entitled SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND CULTURAL PARTICIPATION IN HUNGARY: A
POST-COMMUNIST PATTERN OF CONSUMPTION, about these changes since the fall of
communism.

First, it is interesting to note that even under communism, status competition
remained a factor, as Bukodi writes:
<blockquote>
[T]he stratification of communist societies could be better described as a
status order deriving from differentiation in education, occupational prestige
and income, but one which incorporates inconsistencies, especially as regard
occupational prestige and income. Consequently, individuals in high status
positions could not always distinguish themselves by a high level of material
consumption, and thus, for them, participation in high-brow cultural activities
would appear to have been especially important and desirable . . . High-level
professionals, high-ranking administrators and well-trained technocrats formed
the 'knowledge class' of the 1970s and 1980s, and constituted a status group
with its own cultural means of establishing social closure, in a rather similar
way to that suggested by Bourdieu.
</blockquote>

Yet since the country transitioned to a democracy, the omnivore cultural
pattern, as in other democratic countries, began to prevail:
<blockquote>
[W]hat is suggested is the emergence in the post-communist period of a new
social strata whose members come from relatively advantaged backgrounds, who
enjoy relatively high levels of both cultural and economic resources, and who
seek to make the cultural omnivourousness in which they are able to engage —
rather than exclusiveness — the crucial marker of the high status that they
wish to maintain.
</blockquote>

In general, research papers examining the relation between omnivores and status
often use data on musical taste or attendance at opera, ballet, theatre, and
museums, but omnivores' preference for variety extends beyond traditional art
forms. Warde et al. have
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/42856018">found</a>
that omnivorousness and distinction applies as well to dining out and consuming
ethnic food.
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cyFm20AAAAAJ&hl=en">Josée Johnston</a>
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=zg4U8MAAAAAJ&hl=en">Shyon Baumann</a>
have
<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/518923">found</a>
that omnivores' aspirations towards distinction apply even to the <i>writing</i>
of food, specifically in American gourmet food culture, that omnivores aim to
camouflage themselves as identifying with the common folk, yet this artifical
disguise is precisely what signals their distinction:
<blockquote>
[W]e identify a set of specific discursive strategies that food writers use in
order to socially construct authenticity, and second, we show that authenticity
is employed to provide distinction without overt snobbery . . .
[T]he democratizing effects of an emphasis on authenticity are accompanied by
distinction processes. Authentic food frames are inextricably involved in a
discursive negotiation between ideologies of democracy and distinction. These
ideologies are not either/or influences on the framing process, but interact in
a dialectical tension. Authentic foods are frequently portrayed as more
democratic—they are the foods of common, 'simple' people, produced and consumed
in a 'simple' fashion, connected to age-old traditions, and frequently
presented as superior to stuffy, rule-bound haute cuisine. The democratic
nature of an emphasis on these qualities of food is made explicit in food
writing. What is left implicit, however, is the exclusionary effect of an
emphasis on authenticity . . . [A]uthentic food items are primarily accessible
to cosmopolitan, upper-middle-class individuals with ample grocery budgets who
are capable of extensive global travel, allowing them to eat only
authentic 'Parma' ham or to acquire authentic fish sauce from a remote
Vietnamese island . . . Although unusualness in general is highly valued, there
is a particular type of unusualness that gourmet food writers value especially
highly: unusualness caused by rarity, which allows a relatively subtle
validation of distinction along with cultural and economic capital . . . In our
view, omnivorousness as practiced in the American culinary field calls for a
nuanced reading and analysis, rather than a refutation, of Bourdieu's work on
social class and culture in general, and social class and food more
specifically. The broadening of the culinary repertoire from a narrow and
refined French canon to a world of authentic, exotic, yet still privileged food
manages to preserve the essential qualities of food necessary for it to serve
as cultural capital and distinction, despite democratic ideology condemning
overt displays of cultural status.

One paper from an economics and business perspective by South Korean researchers
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C8ugyesAAAAJ&hl=en">Yoo Jin Kwon</a>
and Kyoung-Nan Kwon finds implications of omnivorous distinction (maybe even
some hypocritical humor?) in marketing:
<blockquote>
Our study revealed an interesting aspect of the social consciousness of
omnivores: culturally tolerant people do, in fact, perceive taste
hierarchically. We conclude this orientation as exclusively inclusive nature of
educated tolerance in cultural issues. Omnivores' consumption styles and their
self-perception of superior taste indicate that their prestige is sustained by
their cultural styles, which are simultaneously broad and exclusive . . .
Marketing communication should be tuned to both appreciation for cultural
diversity and confidence in taste (i.e., superior self-perception). Our results
show that conventional marketing messages emphasizing snobbish elitism or
exclusive distinction is unlikely to appeal to these high-status
individuals . . . American consumer culture now values adaptability to
different cultural contexts and proficiency in the consumption of diverse
values of commodities.
</blockquote>

I'm going to end this research section on cultural omnivores by referencing
this
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X05000471">paper</a>
by
<a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=tIQXT_QAAAAJ&hl=en">Jordi Lopez Sintas</a>
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E_lEjjgAAAAJ&hl=en">Tally Katz-Gerro</a>.
I don't think the paper itself is particularly interesting, as it doesn't come
up with strong conclusions. It uses the 20-year dataset from the National
Endowment of the Arts mentioned earlier and observes the rises and falls, the
inconsistencies and common fluctuations seen by those who work with data, of
cultural consumption across categories, coming up with two new taste patterns:
quasi-omnivorous and entertainment, which like most research probably won't
acquire traction. What I find interesting is something in the title: FROM
EXCLUSIVE TO INCLUSIVE ELITISTS—omnivores are elitists, whether exclusive or
inclusive, whether or not they identify with that label.

This cultural snobbery is related to the present political polarization. A large
part of it stems from a geographic divide between urban and rural areas, and it
has been observed in the Netherlands too, as Kraaykamp et al. in the paper
above write:
<blockquote>
According to Bourdieu . . .  a person's leisure is commensurate to a person's
job. Thus, manual workers who use their muscles are more interested in
activities contesting physical strength, whereas persons in intellectually
demanding jobs are more likely to participate in activities testing
information-processing capabilities . . . If we compare the univores with the
omnivores, we see that coming from a more rural area raises the odds of being a
univore. Here, supply side effects may be the explanation; pop concerts are
found over virtually all the country, whereas highbrow culture is mostly
located in urban areas.
</blockquote>

In the American case,
<a href="https://www.hoover.org/profiles/victor-davis-hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a>
writes in THE CASE FOR TRUMP:
<blockquote>
The new divide . . . is becoming far more encompassing, especially since 2008.
It is an ominous one of an estranged middle class and increasingly expressed in
political, cultural, social, and—most alarmingly—geographic terms . . .
[T]he so-called blue-state model of social media, steep taxes, big government,
social liberty, smaller families, sophisticated culture, and high incomes has
become the more culturally influential . . . The great universities . . . are
on the coasts. They hone the skills necessary to do well from globalized
commerce and trade. When I dine on University Avenue in Palo Alto, the food,
the ambiance, and the people's diction and dress might as well be on Mars, so
foreign are they when compared to eating out in my rural hometown, three
hours—and a world away—south of Fresno, California . . . American muscular jobs
and smokestack industries began disappearing as the world became more
connected . . . The resulting stagnation in the hinterland was almost justified
by elites as an 'I warned you' sort of morality . . . The former nobility of
muscular labor and hard physical work transmogrified into foolish adherence to
mindless drudgery. Confident coastal affluence and chic were seen as almost
preordained, or at least the proper rewards for the right people. Trump saw
that by championing the 'forgotten man,' he was not so easily caricatured as a
heartless Mitt Romney or rich man Jeb Bush . . . The condescending blue-state
narrative was almost as if opioids and trailer houses had driven away hardware
stores, 160-acre farms, and tire factories, rather than the globalized
disappearance of jobs fueling the malaise of the unemployed . . . Gentrification
and the gospel of good taste spread. Blue states began to focus on the cultural
concerns and lifestyles of the upscale, and on generous state sustenance of the
poor and often minority. Privilege and success were camouflaged by a veneer of
trendy progressive politics . . . Coastal elites rarely seemed to stop, reflect,
and ask themselves by what particular standard they were dismissing those of
the interior, much less whether their contempt was only fueling ever greater
countercontempt.
</blockquote>

When Trump was still in office, Alissa Quart
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/22/new-york-city-elite-american-resentment">wrote</a>
in The Guardian:
<blockquote>
[Cultural inequality] is one way to understand the suspicion a chunk of
Americans have – correct or not – that only a small, elite slice of the country
defines what tastes and values are acceptable . . . Kathy J Cramer, a political
scientist at the University of Wisconsin, has seen this sentiment in her
fieldwork. 'The feeling of cultural inequality comes out of the perception that
it is urban culture that gets everything,' she says, meaning that her interview
subjects feel that cities are receiving inordinate financial rewards as well as
media attention and cultural respect . . . [A] cultural elite may be disliked
for reasons that are as not particularly economic: college professors, experts,
NGO staffers and psychotherapists are not corporate titans, after all . . .
Trump and his family may be mining this anti-elite anger, but they are, of
course, preposterously upscale, living in Trump Tower, attending expensive
private schools, flying about in private jets (now with in-flight Secret
Service) and dining in five-star restaurants. Part of how they've gotten away
with it is that they, like Bank of America, are part of a corporate elite
rather than cultural elite. And nowadays the cultural elite can have a markedly
different ethos than its corporate brethren.
</blockquote>

That's quite enough context. I wish to add a few of my own thoughts on the
matter of what may be called a highbrow elite, of cultural snobbery which is
related to coastal, urban snobbery, based not on empirical prevalence but on
ideological ideals, and perhaps this criticism is part of my own reflections,
but it may perhaps also be informative to some stray literary critic, or a
producer of highbrow art, in whatever form it may be, or a serious connoisseur
of the arts, or an English professor who shudders at the mere thought of the
digital humanities providing any value, amenable to a more expansive view.

For someone to maintain a sense of taste and preference in creative products is
perhaps natural, inevitable, necessary, but to additionally harbor a sense of
literary or artistic or musical superiority—snobbery—towards those who lack
familiarity through adequate exposure with what are conventionally considered
the aspirational variants—literary fiction, poetry, classical music, arthouse
film—would be inappropriate, improper, because such an attitude amounts to what
Bourdieu called symbolic violence, of class distinction and class maintenance.
At a time when inequality in the country is especially pronounced, such an
attitude constitutes kicking someone when the person is already down. If this
is the decent perspective given the context, then a further question arises: is
it possible for someone to maintain a private, individual preference for what
would be categorized as high culture without also sustaining some condescension
towards forms which one simply doesn't enjoy, without also thereby letting
one's preferences color one's social relations? Is such a preference simply a
matter of taste, or is such taste, enjoyed by those who tend to be affluent and
educated or by those who wish to associate with such people, never innocent
from implicit class violence? Can someone from the upper middle class,
possessing broad cultural awareness, inhibiting himself from indulging freely
in his whims as he converses with someone from the working class, having only
the most generous of intentions, doing his best to extend common courtesy with
a generous smile, and politely dodging topics that demand the trouble of a
lengthy explanation and risk coming across as arrogant, be said to be free of
symbolic violence? Are class divides ever exempt from class violence? As
William James writes in THE PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGY:
<blockquote>
Properly speaking, a man has as many social selves as there are individuals who
recognize him and carry an image of him in their mind . . . But as the
individuals who carry the images fall naturally into classes, we may
practically say that he has as many different social selves as there are
distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a
different side of himself to each of these different groups . . . We do not
show ourselves to our children as to our club-companions, to our customers as
to the laborers we employ, to our own masters and employers as to our intimate
friends. From this there results what practically is a division of the man into
several selves.
</blockquote>

Or as Thomas Hobbes writes in LEVIATHAN:
<blockquote>
I say the similitude of passions, which are the same in all men,—desire, fear,
hope, etc.; not the similitude of the objects of the passions, which are the
things desired, feared, hoped, etc.: for these the constitution individual,
and particular education, do so vary, and they are so easy to be kept from our
knowledge, that the characters of man's heart, blotted and confounded as they
are with dissembling, lying, counterfeiting, and erroneous doctrines, are
legible only to him that searcheth hearts.

Or as Santayana, writing most recently of these three, which seems like only
yesterday—yes, I wrote this entire post in one day—wrote in 1922:
<blockquote>
But whether the visage we assume be a joyful or a sad one, in adopting and
emphasizing it we define our sovereign temper. Henceforth, so long as we
continue under the spell of this self-knowledge, we do not merely live but act;
we compose and play our chosen character, we wear the buskin of deliberation,
we defend and idealize our passions, we encourage ourselves eloquently to be
what we are, devoted or scornful or careless or austere; we soliloquize
(before an imaginary audience) and we wrap ourselves gracefully in the mantle
of our inalienable part. So draped, we solicit applause and expect to die amid
a universal hush. We profess to live up to the fine sentiments we have uttered,
as we try to believe in the religion we profess. The greater our difficulties
the greater our zeal. Under our published principles and plighted language we
must assiduously hide all the inequalities of our moods and conduct, and this
without hypocrisy, since our deliberate character is more truly ourself than is
the flux of our involuntary dreams. The portrait we paint in this way and
exhibit as our true person may well be in the grand manner, with column and
curtain and distant landscape and finger pointing to the terrestrial globe or
to the Yorick-skull of philosophy; but if this style is native to us and our
art is vital, the more it transmutes its model the deeper and truer art it will
be. The severe bust of an archaic sculpture, scarcely humanizing the block,
will express a spirit far more justly than the man's dull morning looks or
casual grimaces. Every one [sic] who is sure of his mind, or proud of his
office, or anxious about his duty assumes a tragic mask. He deputes it to be
himself and transfers to it almost all his vanity. While still alive and
subject, like all existing things, to the undermining flux of his own
substance, he has crystallized his soul into an idea, and more in pride than in
sorrow he has offered up his life on the altar of the Muses. Self-knowledge,
like any art or science, renders its subject-matter in a new medium, the medium
of ideas, in which it loses its old dimensions and its old pace. Our animal
habits are transmuted by conscience into loyalties and duties, and we
become 'persons' or masks. Art, truth, and death turn everything to marble.

What matters the writings of Borges, Umberto Eco, Paul Celan, Osip Mandelstam,
and of James Joyce and T.S. Eliot, cloistered in layers of difficulty, even
esoterica, if their delights and clarities remain hidden behind unscalably high
walls of self-enforced exclusivity, their efforts and works known to only a few
who bear amongst themselves a pride of cultivated refinement and in-group
identification? And carry that pride they will, well along the silent corridors
of the library stacks, as stately and noble as they are deathly still, scarcely
another soul in sight.

Didn't a famous physicist say that any idea, however complicated, if adequately
understood, can be explained simply? Why shouldn't this concept apply also to
the simplest of things, mere stories, the nature of which are rather basic, the
very stuff anyone can tell and understand? Is it possible to merge the
accessibility of popular entertainment with the elevated poignance, the crisp
individualist expressiveness, the fresh innovative spirit, the novelty and
radiant, unfortunate truths, those characteristics of writing traditionally
considered highbrow and exclusive? Instead of remaining caged within one's
chosen discernment, selecting a particular audience, why not choose instead to
expose the broader public to possibilities beyond a myopic horizon, the same
old, same old, to unorthodox tastes, to flagrant new flavors, to let them judge
whether these renditions are not better? After all, a classically trained
pianist playing at Carnegie Hall does not also expect everyone in the audience,
though able to enjoy music, to have studied it. Why should a writer impose the
corresponding requirement on the reader? I bounced this idea off a poet, who
concluded his long, recalcitrant response with the proverb: "a little knowledge
is a dangerous thing." When he walked away, I had no decent reply, but half an
hour later, some staircase wit dawned on my apparently feeble mind. My response
is based on the popular question: if a tree falls in the forest when no one's
around, does it make a sound?—

poems printed on what paper<br>
cryptic like morning vapor<br>
wait! what's that sound?<br>
a symphony in brass<br>
or just a head full of gas

The contemporary competition in an oversaturated market between elites, between
elites and counter-elites, the status competition in its various forms:
financial, intellectual, artistic, and through educational credentials, through
what
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W0C05zIAAAAJ&hl=en">Peter Turchin</a>
calls elite overproduction, perhaps matters little to the many more who are
locked out of this competition, not having the means in the first place to
participate. As Hesse writes in THE GLASS BEAD GAME, though for a different
context, "But not everyone can spend his entire life breathing, eating, and
drinking nothing but abstractions . . . Abstractions are fine, but I think
people also have to breathe air and eat bread." It is important to keep in mind
that income and status do not necessarily correspond to positive contributions
to society—some occupations, prestigious or not, demanding or not,
well-compensated or not, may well be effectively just taking up space, making
some noise, and giving the impression that work is being done, as David Graeber
describes in his undeniably subtle book BULLSHIT JOBS. Sally Rooney
<a href="https://thedublinreview.com/article/even-if-you-beat-me/">writes</a>
of her experience debating:
<blockquote>
Coming face to face with the irrelevance of your own strivings demands some kind
of response. You can wallow in the pretend celebrity if you want, continue
attending competitions every weekend and dutifully appearing in selfies with
beaming novices, in the belief that you are actually important. Or you can
self-justify in the guise of getting some perspective: maybe try thinking of
reasons why your particular niche is actually of great cultural significance,
or ways in which your skill set applies to 'real life' . . . Participation in a
game, any kind of game, gives you new ways of perceiving others. Victory only
gives you new ways of perceiving yourself.
</blockquote>
Or as Vladimir says in
Beckett's WAITING FOR GODOT: "That passed the time."

But back to the original question, of the novel's precarious place in modernity,
embattled on all sides by newer delights, slowly waning into irrelevance. It is
my general view that the proper response to a formidable challenge, whatever it
may be, is to take the trouble to confront it, to open up one's old habits and
ingrained perspectives to the possibility of change and improvement, to
self-assessment, to comparison, so that at the end of that endeavor one emerges
better than before, matured and humbled and aware of broader horizons, not to
retreat or cower behind an isolated, sheltered reprieve whose comfort and
relief are of the temporary and fragile sort. A satisfactory solution, once
attained, applies everywhere and always until challenged again, and does not
float above a thin veil of willed neglect below which lies an emptiness and
decrepitude afraid to encounter light. When that challenge remains unresolved,
one feels uncomfortable, as one should. My view is that the sense of reward and
gratification come after having attained that solution, not before, not in the
unsustainable form of illusory success and wishful thinking, of patting oneself
on the back when just outside one's window, the harsh reality encroaches by the
minute. Applied to the question at hand, my view is that the novel must be able
to compete against its multiple modern competitors—streaming television,
on-demand films, natural language AI, social media—because why should I sit
down to read a 500-page novel after finishing the day's work if I find greater
pleasure, meaning, and happiness just enjoying myself with easy entertainment?
Why should a novelist expect this of anyone else? I can buy a book, but if I
don't proceed to read it, putting it off to some other day, then again and
again, it's just some decoration sitting on a table. Perhaps it is a form of
respect for others to not generate random noise hurled into the wind, expecting
others to listen, imposing upon them one's arbitrary whims and feel entitled to
their time.

Putting aside the highbrow considerations for a moment, let's consider that book
readership outside of school is declining among children, about which Katherine
Marsh wrote an
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/03/children-reading-books-english-middle-grade/673457/">article</a>
earlier this year in The Atlantic, referencing
<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/589c9a6be6f2e10ec8f0b764/t/62e480ac2af198075148954f/1659142318613/Among+many+U.S.+children%2C+reading+for+fun+has+become+less+common+_+Pew+Research+Center.pdf">data</a>
from Pew, which, Marsh writes, "showed that the percentages of 9- and
13-year-olds who said they read daily for fun had dropped by double digits
since 1984." What's the cause? According to Marsh:
<blockquote>
The ubiquity and allure of screens surely play a large part in this—most
American children have smartphones by the age of 11—as does learning loss
during the pandemic. But this isn't the whole story . . . I recently spoke with
educators and librarians about this trend, and they gave many explanations, but
one of the most compelling—and depressing—is rooted in how our education system
teaches kids to relate to books . . . In New York, where I was in public
elementary school in the early '80s, we did have state assessments that tested
reading level and comprehension, but the focus was on reading as many books as
possible and engaging emotionally with them as a way to develop the requisite
skills. Now the focus on reading analytically seems to be squashing that
organic enjoyment . . . We need to meet kids where they are; for the time
being, I am writing stories that are shorter and less complex. At the same
time, we need to get to the root of the problem, which is not about book
lengths but the larger educational system. We can't let tests control how
teachers teach: Close reading may be easy to measure, but it's not the way to
get kids to fall in love with storytelling.
</blockquote>

If the educational system is one culprit, some may suggest that its emphasis on
testing hinders not only teaching reading but also that of history, math, and
science—what's the point of blindly memorizing facts or mechanically solving
equations as if Google or calculators don't exist when soon after graduation
students with the grace of natural amnesia forget their classroom lessons with
jaw-dropping haste, their only takeaway a bitter recollection of how learning
is not fun or satisfying? This is an interesting question, but this topic is
beyond the scope of this post. An extension of the question: what's the point
of reading a book if it leaves so scant an impact that the reader forgets about
it a few months, or even a few days, later? I don't have the answer, but let's
return briefly to Woolf's HOW SHOULD ONE READ A BOOK?:
<blockquote>
In the first place, I want to emphasize the note of interrogation at the end of
my title. Even if I could answer the question for myself, the answer would
apply only to me and not to you. The only advice, indeed, that one person can
give another about reading is to take no advice, to follow your own instincts,
to use your own reason, to come to your own conclusions . . . To admit
authorities, however heavily furrowed and gowned, into our libraries and let
them tell us how to read, what to read, what value to place upon what we read,
is to destroy the spirit of freedom which is the breath of those sanctuaries.
Everywhere else we may be bound by laws and conventions—there we have none.
</blockquote>

Or, alternatively, Kazuo Ishiguro says:
<blockquote>
I've been emphasising here the small and the private, because essentially that's
what my work is about. One person writing in a quiet room, trying to connect
with another person, reading in another quiet—or maybe not so quiet—room.
Stories can entertain, sometimes teach or argue a point, but for me the
essential thing is that they communicate feelings, that they appeal to what we
share as human beings across our borders and divides. There are large glamorous
industries around stories: the book industry, the movie industry, the
television industry, the theatre industry. But in the end, stories are about
one person saying to another: This is the way it feels to me. Can you
understand what I'm saying? Does it also feel this way to you?
</blockquote>

Long-form writing, whether in a novel or critical essay, if it is to have value
beyond the author's monologue, must hold it own. If it cannot, it is not long
for this world, and nor should it be. What does the novel as a medium offer
which others do not that warrants its continued existence? The novel lacks the
flowing melodies of music and the visual splendors of film and the dramatic
delivery of a speech by a flesh-and-blood actor on stage—the novel is,
truthfully, a bland affair of printed, flat words on a stale page, often
ensconced in a thick tome of yawning intimidation. Novelists, and poets too,
have just one tool at their disposal: words—and through words must flow in
worlds and images, music and silence, company and solitude, reveries and
quietude and rambunctious dissipation—all the while remaining approachable,
humble, accessible, amusing to the sensibilities yet sober, penetrating,
relatable, grounded in reality, unveiling insights as only a novel can, that
which is unable to be found anywhere else. Death, then, to the novels unable to
do so. The modern novelist is tasked with the burden of handling not only the
competition from other novels but also the more immediate gratifications from
other mediums, to use words to keep all else at bay, to say: words alone must
suffice.

<h4>2021-06-29, 二. On Authenticity In Art, Politics, and Taxes.</h4>
David Foster Wallace mentioned a few interesting ideas when he said:
<blockquote>
Let me insert one thing, which I'll bet you've noticed from talking to writers,
is that most of the stuff we think we're writing about in books is very
difficult to talk about straight out, you know, question-and-answer, and in
some sense it probably can't be talked about directly, and that's why people
make up stories about it.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The idea of being a citizen would be to understand your country's history and
the things about it that are good and not so good and how the system works, and
taking the trouble to learn about candidates running for office . . . When
people don't do that, here's what happens. The candidates win who have the most
money to buy television advertisements because television advertisements are
all most voters know about the candidates. Therefore, we get candidates who are
beholden to large donors and become, in some ways, corrupt, which disgusts the
voters and makes the voters even less interested in politics, less willing to
do the work of citizenship . . . Talking about this now, I feel ashamed,
because my saying all this sounds like an older person saying this like a
person lecturing, which in American culture sets me up to be ridiculed. It
would be very easy to make fun of what I'm saying, and I can hear in my head a
voice making fun of this stuff as I'm saying it. And this is the kind of
paradox, I think, of what it is to be a halfway intelligent American right now
and probably also a Western European. There are things we know are right and
good and would be better for us to do, but constantly it's like, 'Yeah, but
it's so much funnier and nicer to go do something else, and who cares? It's all
bullshit anyway.' . . .  The paradox is that sort of tension and complication
and conflict in people also make them very easy to market to, because I can say
to you, 'Feeling uneasy? Life feels empty? Here's something you can buy or
something you can go do.'
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
There's probably more demand for serious books in Europe, but here there's a
small pocket of probably, I don't know, half a million, say a million readers,
many of whom are from the upper classes and have good educations and have been
taught the pleasures of hard work in reading or music or art and like that. I
mean, when you're talking to me, you're talking to someone who doesn't have
very much power in the culture and who's not very important except in a fairly
small—I don't know what the analogue would be. It would be something like
contemporary classical music in the U.S., which there are people who enjoy it
and listen to it, partly because of training and partly because they are
disposed to be willing to do a certain amount more work reading it. But
compared to popular music and rock and roll and hip-hop and stuff, classical
music is nothing, economically or commercially or in terms of how many people
have heard of it or how much an influence it has on the culture . . . I think
in the U.S., people who have been doing serious stuff, which is harder and
stranger, have always played to a much smaller audience . . . Reading requires
sitting alone in a quiet room, and I have friends, intelligent friends, who
don't like to read—it's not just bored—there's an almost dread that comes up
here about having to be alone and having to be quiet. And you see that when you
walk into most public spaces in America, it isn't quiet anymore. They pipe
music through, and the music is easy to make fun of because it's usually really
horrible music, but it seems significant that we don't want things to be quiet
ever anymore. And to me, I don't know if I can defend it, but that seems to me
to have something to do with, when you feel like the purpose of your life is to
gratify yourself and get things for yourself and go all the time, there's this
other part of you that's almost hungry for silence and quiet and thinking
really hard about the same thing for half an hour instead of thirty seconds,
that doesn't get fed at all . . . I think it's true that here in the U.S. every
year the culture gets more and more hostile. It becomes more and more difficult
to ask people to read, or to look at a piece of art for an hour, or to listen
to a piece of music that's complicated and that takes work to understand.

<blockquote>
In the United States, there is another divison, between corporate publishers
and non-profit publishers, who are often very small and do a lot of poetry and
avant-garde fiction. If you are 'lucky' enough to be published by a corporate
publisher, you get more exposure, you get reviewed in the New York Times
instead of just in your local paper, you get translated into other languages,
but literary stuff loses money for corporate publishers almost all the time,
and one of the ways they try to keep from losing money is marketing the
stuff—having the author go around and talk and read—the thing they most like to
do is send you to a bookstore and you give a reading . . . and that generates
free advertising for the book.
</blockquote>

Sally Rooney's take on it:
<blockquote>
Writers turn up to events full of people from a particular class, with a
particular educational background, and essentially the writer sells them the
product which is cultured existence in the form of a commodity, and the
commodity is a book. And people can purchase this book and therefore purchase
their way into a seemingly cultured class. And all the money that changes hands
in the book industry is actually just people paying to belong to a class of
people who read books.
</blockquote>

David Foster Wallace goes on:
<blockquote>
When there's a question-and-answer at the end of a reading, the question is
easy to answer if it's dull or stupid. The good questions are the questions that
can't be answered in a Q-and-A format. They're ones you have to sit down with a
pot of tea or a pot of coffee. They are things that can only be answered in
conversation between two people, and so I always feel vaguely fraudulent . . .
It makes me nervous and self-conscious to try to talk about stuff that I find
almost impossible to talk about, or else to just go, 'So how long are you in
town?'—'Oh, three days.' . . . The whole going around and reading in bookstores
thing, it's turning writers into penny-ante or cheap versions of celebrities.
People aren't usually coming out to hear you read. They're coming to see what
you look like and see whether your voice matches the voice that's in their head
when they read, and it's all—none of it is important.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If you do work like this, you pay certain prices. You don't make as much money,
not as many people read your stuff, but the people who are reading it and are
interested in it—the thing I like about doing this kind of stuff is that I'm
pretty sure my readers are about as smart as I am. I think if you're someone
like Crichton or someone who's a Harvard M.D. but you're writing for a mass
audience, things get very strange. I don't worry that people who are reading my
stuff are misunderstanding it or banalizing it . . . This is something else
about being an American. When I hear 'existential' now, half of me rolls my
eyes—'Oh, what a big sexy philosophical term.' And it becomes hard to speak
seriously about it because all I can hear is being made fun of how serious and
boring and dull I'm being.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I know that there's a paradox in the U.S. of, the people who get powerful jobs
tend to go to really good schools, and often in school you study the liberal
arts, which is philosophy, classical stuff, languages, and it's all very much
about the nobility of the human spirit and broadening the mind. And then from
that, you go to a specialized school to learn how to sue people or to figure
out how to write copy that will make people buy a certain kind of SUV . . . I'm
not sure really that it's ever been all that different. There are things about
my job that I don't like, but this is one of them I do like, is that I get to
use everything I've ever learned or think about . . . I know that there is, at
least in America, an entire class of—and now I'm talking about a very specific
class here—I'm talking about upper and upper-middle class kids whose parents
could afford to send them to very good schools where they got very good
educations, who are often working in jobs that are financially rewarding but
don't have anything to do with they got taught was important and worthwhile in
school.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
What it seems like here is that, television and corporate entertainment,
because it's so expensive, in order to make money it has to appeal to a very
wide audience. Which means it has to find things that a lot of people have in
common. What most of us have in common here are our very most base,
uninteresting, selfish, stupid interests—physical attractiveness, sex, a
certain kind of easy humor, vivid spectacle. That's stuff I will immediately
look at, and so will you. So it's in our very most base and childish interests
that make us a mass. The things that make us interesting and unique and human,
those interests tend to be wildly different between different people.
</blockquote>

David Foster Wallace said this in 2003. Not much has changed, and nor will it,
but indeed he suspected correctly that things have never really been all that
different. In 1880, Dostoyevsky wrote in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV:

<blockquote>
Taking freedom to mean the increase and prompt satisfaction of needs,
[people] distort their own nature, for they generate many meaningless and
foolish desires, habits, and the most absurd fancies in themselves. They live
only for mutual envy, for pleasure-seeking and self-display. To have dinners,
horses, carriages, rank, and slaves to serve them is now considered such a
necessity that for the sake of it, to satisfy it, they will sacrifice life,
honor, the love of mankind, and will even kill themselves if they are unable to
satisfy it . . . I ask you: is such a man free? . . . And therefore the idea of
serving mankind, of the brotherhood and oneness of people, is fading more and
more in the world, and indeed the idea now even meets with mockery, for how can
one drop one's habits, where will this slave go now that he is so accustomed to
satisfying the innumerable needs he himself has invented? He is isolated, and
what does he care about the whole? They have succeeded in amassing more and
more things, but have less and less joy.
</blockquote>

I'll now switch to politics. This first paragraph is directed not at sensible,
well-meaning Republicans but those who follow and agree with Tucker Carlson and
Laura Ingraham. Republicans, scream election fraud all you want; two can play
that game. Populists, if you are so wary of intellectuals, to science, to
thinking and evidence, do you go to the dentist when you have a toothache? To
the hospital when you have cancer? Trusting intellectuals is not socialism.
Physical distancing and wearing masks during a global pandemic caused by an
airborne virus is not socialism. Raising taxes on the rich is not socialism.
The personal income tax, corporate tax, and estate tax are not socialism. If
you think higher taxes for the rich also means higher taxes for struggling
farmers, you've been duped by people who sell their agenda by calling it your
individual liberty when they buy their islands, hide in their bunkers at the
outset of a pandemic, and, when Earth is not enough, race each other to fly to
space. How disgraceful have you become not only as a political party but as
people when you refuse to investigate an attack on your own Capitol? Consider
for a moment the possibility that those you revile as intellectuals spend
considerable time thinking about problems you yourself do not, and sometimes
facing truth requires putting aside blind national pride. How is it possible
with all the knowledge and advancements of modernity we have in America a
movement steeped in
<a href="https://www.studioatao.org/post/understanding-anti-intellectualism-in-the-u-s">anti-intellectualism</a>?
Let me get to the point. Religious fundamentalists teach distrust towards
intellectuals to silence alternative worldviews in an increasingly secular
society where they are losing power as their followers, becoming
self-sufficient, break away. And what happens when anti-intellectualism is
taken to the extreme? History offers a few data points. In 1915, Ottomans,
fearing Armenian independence, began their genocide first with the
intellectuals to remove leadership. In the 1960s Mao launched the Cultural
Revolution in China in which for a full decade academics, scientists,
professors, and any intellectual ranging from those employed in the
institutions down to recent college graduates, all associated with the
bourgeois, were implicated and were marched in public in humiliation, beaten,
killed, or sent to work on farms, and schools and universities were closed,
sending scholarship and literacy down a monumental backslide in a country that
had for many centuries prized education, all to consolidate power for himself
in the name of glorifying the people, whose descendants now are more drawn to
material excess than the humility of the long time prior. We in American have
not yet descended so low, but when the people elect someone who withdraws from
the WHO, seriously considers pulling out of NATO, promises to revive the coal
industry, and repeatedly disregards the recommendations of scientists during a
global pandemic, do we suppose we are heading in the right direction? In
antiquity, Plato advocated for a philosopher king, and through all the progress
we've made since then we've come to be threatened by duplicitous capitalists
appealing to irrational fear and incompetence. After the Capitol rioters
succeeded in seizing the building, looting and destroying, they meandered
about, having ridden the tide of hysteria and rage to find themselves without
any idea what to do next, pawns to someone afraid of losing power.

I'll now talk reasonably. This section talks about taxes and also, because this
topic relates to wealth, politics. Full disclosure: I'm not an economist or a
tax lawyer, nor do I believe I'm going to change anyone's views on this. The
question of whether the rich are already being taxed enough seems nearly as
difficult as the question of whether a God or gods exist. You already have an
answer you believe in, and what you see will either confirm your position or
raise your suspicion at its correctness. For those who like me are not experts
in tax research and who are interested in my side, which calls for equitable
redistribution of resources, the notable researchers are these French
economists:
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q_E5lH4AAAAJ&hl=en">Thomas Piketty</a>,
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qZpr_CQAAAAJ&hl=en">Emmanuel Saez</a>,
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GbOivREAAAAJ&hl=en">Gabriel Zucman</a>.
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PhDDPiUAAAAJ&hl=en">Raj Chetty</a>
also does promising and very interesting work on the country's inequality and
unequal access to opportunity. But case in point on the difficulty of the tax
question: in 2011 Saez, with Nobel laureate Peter Diamond, calculated that the
optimal tax rate for the highest income bracket in the U.S. is
<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.25.4.165">73%</a>.
Currently, it is
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/publications/federal-tax-rates-and-tax-brackets/#brackets">37%</a>.
The principle behind this high rate is optimal tax theory, which aims to
maximize everyone's well-being without inhibiting innovation. For comparison,
AOC's proposed tax rate is 70% on—this is key—only income higher than $10
million. The great majority of American families do not reach that threshold.
Then, a paper like
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2550936">this</a>
points out the logistical impracticalities of raising taxes.
And
<a href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/optimal-top-tax-rates-review-critique">this</a>
from Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, modifies two parameters in the
model. The author writes of the original paper, "They argued that, if the
Pareto parameter is 1.5 and the ETI is 0.25, then 'τ* = 1/(1 + 1.5 × 0.25) = 73
percent'. If that formula is accepted uncritically, then the conclusion follows
from the premises. But neither the formula itself, nor the two parameters
(Pareto and elasticity) need be accepted uncritically. If this was a recipe for
baking a cake, it might be prudent to question both the recipe and the
ingredients." The author also writes, "with empirically credible changes in
parameters, the Diamond‐Saez formula can more easily be used to show that top
U.S. federal, state, and local tax rates are already too high rather than too
low." However, the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank
supports the high rate,
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-income-taxes/">writing</a>,
"The policy implications of this research are that increasing top marginal tax
rates can raise substantial sums of revenue and potentially dampen the rise of
income inequality without unduly restraining economic growth." I think this
kind of disagreement is ridiculous. For comparison, even though machine
learning research has a lot of bloat and myriad models, parameters, and
modifications to explore, at the end of the day there is consensus on a model's
performance because researchers don't question the evaluation metrics. But when
it comes to taxes, because money is involved, where a right-leaning think tank
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/rich-pay-their-fair-share-of-taxes/">says</a>
the rich are already paying their fair share, a left-leaning one has
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/decades-of-rising-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s-testimony-before-the-u-s-house-of-representatives-ways-and-means-committee/#share">data</a>
suggesting they don't. Opposing
<a href="https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/1-chart-how-much-the-rich-pay-taxes">these</a>
facts are also
<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-fairness-briefing-booklet/fact-sheet-corporate-tax-rates/">these</a>.
And what does the public think? One
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/04/growing-partisan-divide-over-fairness-of-the-nations-tax-system/">poll</a>
shows 60% of Americans say that it bothers them a lot that some wealthy people
don't pay their fair share, and that views on the country's tax system is
increasingly colored by political affiliation.

I think the interesting question isn't: Are the rich paying their fair share of
income taxes? but rather: Why is inequality still rising when the rich are
already paying so much? By "so much", I mean the fact that in 2018 the top 1%,
according to the two conservatives' links at the end of the paragraph above, the
numbers also corroborated by another Tax Foundation
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/publications/latest-federal-income-tax-data/">article</a>,
earned 21% of all income but paid 40% of federal income taxes, and the top 10%
earned 48% of the income but paid 71% of the taxes. Before I go further, I
think it's important to put these numbers in perspective. Using a flat rate for
simplicity, taxing 20% on someone making $100,000 does not have the same effect
on the standard of living as 20% on someone making $10,000,000, which would
produce a much larger share of the taxes between the two. I think the answer to
this question: Do the rich pay their fair share of income taxes? is: yes. But
this is not the right question because income is only part of the picture. You
might wonder how inequality is still rising if the wealthy pay their fair share
of income taxes. Conservatives are hesitant to talk about the other variable:
existing wealth. The real equation of annual net worth growth is:

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white; text-align:center;">
net worth growth = income + wealth growth - debt growth
</pre>

where

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
income = salary, wages, interest, dividends, etc.
wealth growth = stock appreciation, real estate appreciation, etc.
</pre>

Among the rich, wealth growth dominates. I'm going to focus on wealth growth
from stocks which, in our current system, favors those who already own them,
and those with more shares benefit disproportionately from rising values and
begin to own more and more, i.e. the game is rigged. Piketty wrote a more
complete discussion on this kind of growing inequality in CAPITAL IN THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. Piketty traced the history of wealth and inequality and
observed that when investment growth alone outpaces the rest of the economy,
the inevitable end is rising inequality. His recommended solution is a
progressive wealth tax, which is what I also believe in. It is crucial to keep
in mind that the wealth tax is separate from the income tax most people are
familiar with. The wealth tax is imposed on already acquired wealth which for
the rich is the main instrument for wealth growth, a method that is out of
reach of most Americans. The U.S. has never had a wealth tax, and it is not
hard to imagine who might go to extraordinary lengths to prevent one and why
they might call it unconstitutional.

In 2019, the Federal Reserve released a
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019017pap.pdf">paper</a>
describing the rising wealth inequality:
<blockquote>
At the highest level, the [Distributed Financial Accounts] show significant
wealth concentration and a clear increase in wealth concentration since
1989 . . . In 2018, the top 10% of U.S. households controlled 70 percent of
total household wealth, up from 60 percent in 1989. The share of the top 1% of
the wealth distribution increased from 23 percent to nearly 32 percent from
1989 to 2018. The increase in the wealth share of the top 10% came at the
expense of households in the 50th to 90th percentiles of the wealth
distribution, whose share decreased from 36 percent to 29 percent over this
period . . . [T]he bottom 50% of the wealth distribution experienced virtually
no increase in their nominal net worth over the last 30 years, resulting in a
fall in total wealth share from 4 percent in 1989 to just 1 percent in 2018.
The rise in wealth concentration stems primarily from increased concentration
of assets . . . with trends for assets largely mimicking those for overall
wealth. The share of assets held by the top 10% of the wealth distribution rose
from 55 percent to 64 percent since 1989, with asset shares increasing the most
for the top 1% of households. These increases were mirrored by decreases for
households in the 50-90th percentiles of the wealth distribution . . .
[W]e observe that the share of real estate held by the top 10% of the wealth
distribution has increased by 5 percentage points from 39 percent to 44
percent, suggesting that increases in wealthy households' share of real estate
holdings have contributed to the increase in concentration . . . [C]orporate and
noncorporate business equity have been large drivers of wealth concentration.
The distribution of these assets has long been skewed: in 1989, the richest 10%
of households held 80 percent of corporate equity and 78 percent of equity in
noncorporate business. Since 1989, the top 10%'s share of corporate equity has
increased, on net, from 80 percent to 87 percent, and their share of
noncorporate business equity has increased, on net, from 78 percent to 86
percent. Furthermore, most of these increases in business equity holdings have
been realized by the top 1%, whose corporate equity shares increased from 39
percent to 50 percent and noncorporate equity shares increased from 42 percent
to 53 percent since 1989.

The paper contains charts of the data, but it's easier to go to an
interactive version for the
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WFRBST01122,WFRBSN09149,WFRBSN40176,WFRBSB50203">stock dataset</a>
from the Federal Reserve's database. We see that stocks are predominantly owned
by the wealthy, and their share has grown in the last 30 years. The share
among the top 10% in Q1 1991 was 79.7% and rose in Q1 2021 to 88.7%. We also
see that since at least as far back as 1989, the bottom 50% have never owned
more than 1.8% and in 2021 owned 0.6%, which is next to nothing. Another
dataset shows the
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WFRBST01134,WFRBSN09161,WFRBSN40188,WFRBSB50215">net worth distribution</a>,
and the same pattern emerges. The share among the top 10% in Q1 1991 was 60.3%
and rose in Q1 2021 to 69.8%. The bottom 50% never owned more than 4.3% since
1989 and in 2021 owned a mere 2%. The Pew Research Center also has
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/psdt_01-10-20_economic-inequality_1-4/">data</a>
showing the growing wealth inequality. When we also account for wealth, the
question "Do the rich pay their fair share?" takes on a different meaning. The
income tax numbers that conservatives toss about are only skirting around the
issue. That the top 10% earned 48% of one year's income but paid 71% of the
year's taxes no longer puts the burden on the poor when we see that the bottom
50% have almost nothing to tax. According to the Tax Policy Center,
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-fact/income-salaries-and-wages-ff-06212021">the portion of income</a>
from salaries and wages also diverges by income class. For households with an
adjusted gross income less than $500,000, most (71%-81%) of the income came
from salaries and wages—from working. For households whose AGI is at least $10
million, that portion shrinks to 17%. The majority of their income likely comes
from bond interest and dividends—from their wealth by either investing or
owning shares of their own company. Inequality also plays out in college
admissions. An
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">article</a>
from The Times visualizes data from a study co-authored by Raj Chetty and Saez,
finding that:
<blockquote>
At 38 colleges in America, including five in the Ivy League . . . more
students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire
bottom 60 percent. Roughly one in four of the richest students attend an elite
college – universities that typically cluster toward the top of annual
rankings. In contrast, less than one-half of 1 percent of children from the
bottom fifth of American families attend an elite college; less than half
attend any college at all.
</blockquote>

It is important to distinguish between groups within the top 1%, which has its
own massive internal inequalities. The Chicago Booth Review has an
<a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent">article</a>
that differentiates the average income in 2015 between four segments in the top
1% (0.5%-1%, 0.1%-0.5%, 0.01%-0.1%, and the top 0.01%), and even in this
echelon, the wealthier acquire wealth faster; each step from one group to its
next higher group is a jump on an exponential curve, from $485 thousand to $901
thousand to $2.9 million to $18.9 million. The richest group, the 0.01%, are
the 1 percenters of the 1 percent. Inequality.org gives a more concrete look at
the wealthy, splitting the top 10% into five groups and gave a brief
descriptive
<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/taxing-rich-starts-knowing-who-they-are/">profile</a>
of each one. One investment manager suggests that there is a large divide
between the bottom and top halves of the top 1%. In 2011 he
<a href="https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/investment_manager.html">emailed</a>
Bill Domhoff at WHO RULES AMERICA? the trouble he saw in the economy's
inequality, particularly as caused by the top 0.5%. He remained anonymous to
protect his identity since his clients are primarily the ones he is
criticizing, as they "largely fall into the top 1%, have a net worth of
$5,000,000 or above, and — if working — make over $300,000 per year." He writes
of the lower half:
<blockquote>
The 99th to 99.5th percentiles largely include physicians, attorneys, upper
middle management, and small business people who have done well . . . The net
worth for those in the lower half of the top 1% is usually achieved after
decades of education, hard work, saving and investing as a professional or
small business person. While an after-tax income of $175k to $250k and net
worth in the $1.2M to $1.8M range may seem like a lot of money to most
Americans, it doesn't really buy freedom from financial worry or access to the
true corridors of power and money. That doesn't become frequent until we reach
the top 0.1% . . . Our poor lower half of the top 1% lives well but has some
financial worries. Since the majority of those in this group actually earned
their money from professions and smaller businesses, they generally don't
participate in the benefits big money enjoys. Those in the 99th to 99.5th
percentile lack access to power . . . Unlike those in the lower half of the top
1%, those in the top half and, particularly, top 0.1%, can often borrow for
almost nothing, keep profits and production overseas, hold personal assets in
tax havens, ride out down markets and economies, and influence legislation in
the U.S. They have access to the very best in accounting firms, tax and other
attorneys, numerous consultants, private wealth managers, a network of other
wealthy and powerful friends, lucrative business opportunities, and many other
benefits. Most of those in the bottom half of the top 1% lack power and global
flexibility and are essentially well-compensated workhorses for the top 0.5%,
just like the bottom 99%. In my view, the American dream of striking it rich is
merely a well-marketed fantasy that keeps the bottom 99.5% hoping for better
and prevents social and political instability. The odds of getting into that
top 0.5% are very slim and the door is kept firmly shut by those within it.
</blockquote>
The investment manager then describes the upper half:
<blockquote>
Membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some
aspect of the financial services or banking industry, real estate development
involved with those industries, or government contracting. Some hard working
and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as $15M-$20M before
retirement but they are rare. Those in the top 0.5% have incomes over $500k if
working and a net worth over $1.8M if retired. The higher we go up into the top
0.5% the more likely it is that their wealth is in some way tied to the
investment industry and borrowed money than from personally selling goods or
services or labor as do most in the bottom 99.5%. They are much more likely to
have built their net worth from stock options and capital gains in stocks and
real estate and private business sales, not from income which is taxed at a
much higher rate. These opportunities are largely unavailable to the bottom
99.5% . . . The picture is clear; entry into the top 0.5% and, particularly,
the top 0.1% is usually the result of some association with the financial
industry and its creations. I find it questionable as to whether the majority
in this group actually adds value or simply diverts value from the US economy
and business into its pockets and the pockets of the uber-wealthy who hire
them. They are, of course, doing nothing illegal . . . A highly complex set of
laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the
uppermost reaches of the U.S. financial system. It allows them to protect and
increase their wealth and significantly affect the U.S. political and
legislative processes. They have real power and real wealth. Ordinary citizens
in the bottom 99.9% are largely not aware of these systems, do not understand
how they work, are unlikely to participate in them, and have little likelihood
of entering the top 0.5%, much less the top 0.1%. Moreover, those at the very
top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules. I am not
optimistic.
</blockquote>
In a 2014 addendum, the investment manager wrote:
<blockquote>
One might think that physicians, America's highest-paid professional group,
would be largely exempt from the economic currents affecting most other
Americans. This isn't so. Medscape, a key physician website, reports that as of
2013, mean income for male physicians in all specialties was $259k; for female
physicians, it was $199k. Family practice doctors and internists earned the
least, averaging around $175k. Orthopedic surgeons earned the most, averaging
around $405k; they are the only physician specialty falling within the top 1%
by income . . . If our hypothetical physician saves and invests for 35 years,
he will have contributed less than $2 million dollars to retirement plans . . .
Thus, an average physician — while doing very well by most people's standards —
is unlikely to earn or accumulate enough to place him or her in the top 1% by
income or net worth at the end of their career. Opportunity for most Americans,
even physicians, is decreasing, even while net worth and income accelerate for
those at the very top of the system. If an average physician today is unlikely
to make it into the top 1% (Piketty and Saez's end-of-2012 data show that the
1% income line is crossed with an income of $396k per year), then it seems
pretty clear that crossing that line via income, savings, and investments will
be impossible for nearly every American in the future.

He wrote also about someone who put up with finance enough to retire early, and
her account of investment banking reminded me of academia, only the currency
there is not money, and there's not so much as damage to anything as a large
part of it will never see the light of day and has no other purpose than
publication:
<blockquote>
Recently, I spoke with a younger client who retired from a major
investment bank in her early thirties, net worth around $8M. Since I knew she
held a critical view of investment banking, I asked if her colleagues talked
about or understood how much damage was created in the broader economy from
their activities. Her answer was that no one talks about it in public but
almost all understood and were unbelievably cynical, hoping to exit the system
when they became rich enough.
</blockquote>

What does net worth growth look like for those in the highest echelon? Let's
look at Stephen Schwarzman's in 2020. I have nothing personal against
Schwarzman; he has a history of philanthropy, and he's signed The Giving
Pledge. I'm just using his wealth as an example. According to Reuters,
Schwarzman
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackstone-group-ceo-compensation/blackstone-ceo-schwarzman-took-home-610-5-million-in-2020-idUSKBN2AT2V7">received</a>
$86.4 million in compensation and $524.1 million in dividends from his
Blackstone shares, for a total income of at least $610.5 million. What about
his wealth growth, considering solely his earnings from Blackstone? According
to the same link, he owns 19.3% of Blackstone, which had
<a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/BX/shares_outstanding">682.91 million</a>
shares outstanding in 2/2020, so he owned 131.8 million shares. Using stock
price
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BX/">data</a>
from Yahoo Finance:

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
Share Price, 2/2020     Share Price, 12/2020     Price Change    Wealth Growth
       $53.84                  $64.81              $10.97           $1.4B
</pre>

Forbes
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/stephen-schwarzman/?sh=ffc2fea234a2">shows</a>
his net worth in 4/2020 was $15.4 billion and rose to $19.1 billion in 9/2020,
so he has more earnings than from Blackstone alone. Because the government does
not tax wealth, it is only when Schwarzman sells his shares that his earnings
get taxed. If Schwarzman holds on to his shares for at least a year, which he
already has, he avoids paying the higher rates of the ordinary income
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#brackets">tax brackets</a>
(10%-37%) and gets charged the
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#capgains">lower rates</a>
(0%-20%) of long-term capital gains. But what happens if Schwarzman doesn't sell
his stocks? From a recent ProPublica
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">report</a>:
<blockquote>
The notion of dying as a tax benefit seems paradoxical. Normally when someone
sells an asset, even a minute before they die, they owe 20% capital gains tax.
But at death, that changes. Any capital gains till that moment are not taxed.
This allows the ultrarich and their heirs to avoid paying billions in taxes.
The 'step-up in basis' is widely recognized by experts across the political
spectrum as a flaw in the code.
</blockquote>
Dividends from stocks, however, do count as taxable income, but investors can
avoid that burden by choosing companies that reinvest in themselves rather than
pay dividends; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway does not pay dividends. If
the rich avoid receiving income, how do they pay for their large purchases?
I've not yet mentioned the third variable in the net worth growth equation:
debt. It turns out that if you're ultrawealthy, you can borrow money to avoid
taxes. According to the same ProPublica report:
<blockquote>
For regular people, borrowing money is often something done out of necessity,
say for a car or a home. But for the ultrawealthy, it can be a way to access
billions without producing income, and thus, income tax. The tax math provides
a clear incentive for this. If you own a company and take a huge salary, you'll
pay 37% in income tax on the bulk of it. Sell stock and you'll pay 20% in
capital gains tax — and lose some control over your company. But take out a
loan, and these days you'll pay a single-digit interest rate and no tax; since
loans must be paid back, the IRS doesn't consider them income. Banks typically
require collateral, but the wealthy have plenty of that.

Abigail Disney, an heiress of the Disney family, is among the exceptions in
America's aristocrats in that she has a conscience to admit the failings of the
system. She
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/abigail-disney-rich-protect-dynastic-wealth-propublica-tax/619212/">writes</a>
in The Atlantic a response to the ProPublica report:
<blockquote>
Nowhere does ProPublica assert that these men cheated, lied, or did anything
felonious to lower their tax burdens. The naked fact of the matter is that not
a single one of the documented methods and practices that allowed these
billionaires to so radically minimize their tax obligations was illegal. What's
worse, these methods and practices—things such as offsetting income with losses
in unrelated businesses; structuring assets to grow rather than generate
income, then borrowing against those growing assets for cash needs; and
deducting interest payments and state taxes from taxable income—are so
downright mundane and commonly applied that most rich people don't see them as
unethical. The more interesting question is not how the men in ProPublica's
report were able to avoid paying much or anything in federal income taxes, but
why. What motivates people with so much money to try to withhold every last bit
of it from the public's reach? . . . Having money—a lot of money—is very, very
nice. It's damn hard to resist the seductions of what money buys you. I've
never been much of a materialist, but I have wallowed in the less concrete
privileges that come with a trust fund, such as time, control, security,
attention, power, and choice. The fact is, this is pretty standard software
that comes with the hardware of a human body. As time has passed, I have
realized that the dynamics of wealth are similar to the dynamics of addiction.
The more you have, the more you need. Whereas once a single beer was enough to
achieve a feeling of calm, now you find that you can't stop at six. Likewise,
if you move up from coach to business to first class, you won't want to go back
to coach. And once you've flown private, wild horses will never drag you
through a public airport terminal again. Comforts, once gained, become
necessities. And if enough of those comforts become necessities, you eventually
peel yourself away from any kind of common feeling with the rest of humanity.
The older I've gotten and the more clearly I've understood these things, the
more the impulse to betray my own class has taken charge of my judgment. What's
shocking about the ProPublica report is not just that the tax bills are so low,
but that these billionaires can live with themselves.

Abigail Disney also references David Foster Wallace's THIS IS WATER commencement
speech in 2005 at Kenyon College: "All I know is that if you are a fish, it is
hard to describe water, much less to ask if water is necessary, ethical, and
structured the way it ought to be."

To an average American family earning $70,000 a year, an additional $10,000
makes a sizable impact. To someone in this stratosphere, an additional million
or two makes no meaningful difference. In the end, there are two choices for
the ultrawealthy: 1) signing
<a href="https://givingpledge.org/">The Giving Pledge</a>
to give to charity most of the fortunes made in their lifetimes by their own
accomplishment, which Schwarzman and Buffett have done, and 2) starting a new
capitalist dynasty like these
<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-richest-families-in-america/">families</a>
whose heirs know it is best to stay away from the limelight, instead protecting
their wealth by calling for lower taxes and lobbying in various forms, such as
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/estatetaxfinal.pdf">repealing</a>
the estate tax, calling it the death tax to scare the common American to whom
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-many-people-pay-estate-tax">the tax would never apply</a>.

The wealth tax isn't a new idea; it's already been proposed in politics. Bernie
Sanders
<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/">proposes</a>
a wealth tax that would:
<blockquote>
only apply to net worth of over $32 million and anyone who has a net worth of
less than $32 million, would not see their taxes go up at all under this
plan . . . This tax on extreme wealth would have a progressive rate structure
that would only apply to the wealthiest 180,000 households in America who are
in the top 0.1 percent. It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above
$32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5
million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000. The tax rate would increase to 2
percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500
million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5
billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion,
and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for
singles. Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over
15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and
power of this small privileged class.
</blockquote>
This last sentence, of course, would not make the referenced class happy.
Elizabeth Warren's more lenient
<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax">version</a>
of the wealth tax raises the minimum threshold at which the tax starts and has
lower rates: "Zero additional tax on any household with a net worth of less
than $50 million (99.9% of American households)." The tax for the wealthy
is: "2% annual tax on household net worth between $50 million and $1 billion",
and for billionaires: "4% annual Billionaire Surtax (6% tax overall) on
household net worth above $1 billion". Furthermore, research suggests that more
equitable distribution of economic growth leads to more opportunity for all.
Raj Chetty
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6336/398.full">found</a>
that:
<blockquote>
rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children
born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates
experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP
growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would
reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that
reviving the 'American dream' of high rates of absolute mobility would require
economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.
</blockquote>
We have data that confirm that taxes successfully redistribute income and reduce
inequality. Our World in Data
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality#redistribution-through-tax-and-transfer-policies">visualized</a>
income distributions before and after taxes, as they currently stand, for
multiple countries and found that "inequality is not only reduced by
redistribution between individuals at a given point in time, but also by
achieving redistribution over the course of life." OWID also has an
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-inequality-gini-index?tab=chart&country=USA~FRA~DNK~DEU~ISL~GBR~CHE~SWE~ITA~NOR">interactive visualization</a>
comparing inequality between the U.S. and several European countries. The U.S.
notably has the highest inequality, and lowest inequality is in the group of
Scandinavian countries which have higher taxes to support a broader system of
government services.

I should mention explicitly that I do not support socialism. It didn't work out
well for the countries that ran that experiment, but unbridled capitalism leads
to growing inequality and does not yield equal opportunity for all. Inequality
is presumed and necessary in capitalism, but what is the right level of
inequality? One
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437115003738">paper</a>
proposed that the fairest inequality is a lognormal distribution. The paper
hasn't generated much interest, and I suspect this is a hard problem, not to
mention the politics involved, so this question is not one I'm going to
explore.

I don't think the main driver of the economy relates solely to taxation, but a
classic Republican claim is that lower taxes jumpstarts the economy. I'm not
convinced. If an old-school Republican points to Reagan's economic success by
lowering taxes, I'll point out that Clinton did better
in terms of
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Presidential_Comparison_Real_GDP_-_v1.png">GDP</a>
and
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Job_Growth_by_U.S._President_-_v1.png">job growth</a> with higher taxes on the
wealthy. The Federal Reserve has job growth
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USPRIV">data</a>
since 1939 in absolute terms. Clinton did
<a href="https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/textonly/WH/Accomplishments/Small_Business.html">lower taxes</a>
for businesses, but it was for small businesses, not the wealthy. It certainly
wasn't a trickle-down utopia. And Mike Pence recently
<a href="https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/bidens-china-first-tax-plan-americans-come-last-presidents-jobs-plan">wrote</a>:
<blockquote>
Under the Trump-Pence administration, we proved that low taxes are the key to
creating prosperity for Americans of every background and income group. In
2017, we passed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which delivered more than
$3.2 trillion in tax relief to American families and businesses. Within months,
our economy took off like a rocket. America gained more than 7 million new
jobs, unemployment plummeted to the lowest rate in 50 years, and more than 10
million people were lifted off of welfare—the largest reduction in poverty in
modern history.
</blockquote>
Actually, they didn't prove anything. The two job growth links above put Pence's
claims in context. In addition, we can compare Trump's numbers and Obama's.
FactCheck.org
<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/obamas-final-numbers/">summarized</a>
the numbers at the end of Obama's
term: "The economy gained a net 11.6 million jobs. The unemployment rate
dropped to below the historical norm." The numbers Pence mentions were not caused by Trump's
TCJA. The unemployment rate data
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE">show</a>
that by the time Trump took office, unemployment was already in decline, a trend
Obama started when he became president in 2009 immediately after the recession.
If Trump improved on Obama's performance, we would see a steep drop in
unemployment starting in 2017, but we don't. Again, Trump's TCJA didn't prove
anything. What about Biden's tax proposal? Lately there's been a lot of
intimidating news about it, with some calling it outright socialism. I will not
give them more coverage by linking to them, but Biden's tax hike is not
socialism. According to the Tax Foundation's
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/biden-tax-plan-tracker/">Biden tax tracker</a>,
Biden's tax hike to fund his infrastructure plan would "raise the top marginal income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent".
How does this compare to the historic rates? The Tax Policy Center has
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates">tabulated</a>
the top marginal rate from 1913 to 2020. Biden's new rate of 39.6% is the same
as Clinton's when he was in office between 1993 and 2001. What Biden is
proposing is not socialism. For a complete listing of the tax bracket history,
the Tax Foundation has a
<a href="https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/fed_individual_rate_history_nominal.pdf">document</a>
that shows all the rates between 1913 and 2013. Furthermore, no one called the
taxes socialism in the 1950s when the top marginal rate was 91%. To be fair,
this high rate should be construed with a grain of salt because in fact the
effective tax rate for the rich was not much higher than it is these days. One
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/">analysis</a>
shows that "between 1950 and 1959, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an
average of 42.0 percent of their income in federal, state, and local taxes.
Since then, the average effective tax rate of the top 1 percent has declined
slightly overall. In 2014, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an average tax
rate of 36.4 percent." This was perhaps because few households fell into the
top bracket or simply due to tax evasion. However, my point is that even the
91% rate of the 1950s was not rampantly labeled socialism the way Biden's
proposal currently is. It's not socialism. The Tax Policy Center has also
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/biden-would-raise-taxes-substantially-high-income-households-and-corporations-cut-taxes">analyzed</a>
Biden's tax increases: "Nearly all of President Biden's proposed tax increases
would be borne by the highest income 1 percent of households—those making about
$800,000 or more . . . At the same time, Biden would cut taxes for many low-
and moderate-income households and reduce them substantially for those with
children." All the scare about impending doom sounds to me like the wealthy
don't want to pay more taxes to help relieve the country's inequality.

The idea of fixing economic inequality is only a start. This is the solution
that's obvious in light of the data, and it's what progressives push for, yet
policy changes, redistributing wealth, and improving opportunities are not
adequate solutions when we assume we understand the working class without
actually seeing their perspective and troubles. If you are reading this, you in
all likelihood are not in this class. David Shipler's THE WORKING POOR:
INVISIBLE IN AMERICA offers a profile:
<blockquote>
The man who washes cars does not own one. The clerk who files cancelled checks
at the bank has $2.02 in her account. The woman who copyedits medical textbooks
has not been to a dentist in a decade. This is the forgotten America. At the
bottom of its working world, millions live in the shadow of prosperity, in the
twilight between poverty and well-being. Whether you're rich, poor, or
middle-class, you encounter them every day . . . Those with luck or talent step
onto career ladders toward better and better positions at higher and higher
pay. Many more, however, are stuck at such low wages that their living
standards are unchanged. They still cannot save, cannot get decent health care,
cannot move to better neighborhoods, and cannot send their children to schools
that offer a promise for a successful future. These are the forgotten
Americans, who are noticed and counted as they leave welfare, but who disappear
from the nation's radar as they struggle in their working lives. Breaking away
and moving a comfortable distance from poverty seems to require a perfect
lineup of favorable conditions. A set of skills, a good starting wage, and a
job with the likelihood of promotion are prerequisites. But so are clarity of
purpose, courageous self-esteem, a lack of substantial debt, the freedom from
illness or addiction, a functional family, a network of upstanding friends, and
the right help from private or governmental agencies. Any gap in that array is
an entry point for trouble, because being poor means being unprotected. You
might as well try playing quarterback with no helmet, no padding, no training,
and no experience, behind a line of hundred-pound weaklings. With no cushion of
money, no training in the ways of the wider world, and too little defense
against the threats and temptations of decaying communities, a poor man or
woman gets sacked again and again—buffeted and bruised and defeated. When an
exception breaks this cycle of failure, it is called the fulfillment of the
American Dream . . . The working individuals in this book are neither helpless
nor omnipotent, but stand on various points along the spectrum between the
polar opposites of personal and societal responsibility. Each person's life is
the mixed product of bad choices and bad fortune, of roads not taken and roads
cut off by the accident of birth or circumstance. It is difficult to find
someone whose poverty is not somehow related to his or her unwise behavior—to
drop out of school, to have a baby out of wedlock, to do drugs, to be
chronically late to work. And it is difficult to find behavior that is not
somehow related to the inherited conditions of being poorly parented, poorly
educated, poorly housed in neighborhoods from which no distant horizon of
possiblity can been seen . . . For practically every family, then, the
ingredients of poverty are part financial and part psychological, part personal
and part societal, part past and part present. Every problem magnifies the
impact of the others, and all are so tightly interlocked that one reversal can
produce a chain reaction with results far distant from the original cause. A
run-down apartment can exacerbate a child's asthma, which leads to a call for
an ambulance, which generates a medical bill that cannot be paid, which ruins a
credit record, which hikes the interest rate on an auto loan, which forces the
purchase of an unreliable used car, which jeopardizes a mother's punctuality at
work, which limits her promotion and earning capacity, which confines her to
poor housing. If she or any other impoverished working parent added up all her
individual problems, the whole would be equal to more than the sum of its
parts.
</blockquote>
Shipler wrote this in 2004 after spending time with people living in poverty.
The people he wrote about were demographically representative, across gender
and race. A more recent book provides the view specifically into the white
working class who support Trump, and policies would not help them without
knowing their problem, that their stresses cause them to dissociate from
participation, that, for many, they cannot see it in themselves to improve.
J.D. Vance writes of Appalachia's despair in HILLBILLY ELEGY:
<blockquote>
This isn't some libertarian mistrust of government policy, which is healthy in
any democracy. This is deep skepticism of the very institutions of our society.
And it's becoming more and more mainstream. We can't trust the evening news. We
can't trust our politicians. Our universities, the gateway to a better life,
are rigged against us. We can't get jobs. You can't believe these things and
participate meaningfully in society. Social psychologists have shown that group
belief is a powerful motivator in performance. When groups perceive that it's
in their interest to work hard and achieve things, members of that group
outperform other similarly situated individuals. It's obvious why: If you
believe that hard work pays off, then you work hard; if you think it's hard to
get ahead even when you try, then why try at all? Similarly, when people do
fail, this mind-set allows them to look outward. I once ran into an old
acquaintance at a Middletown bar who told me that he had recently quit his job
because he was sick of waking up early. I later saw him complaining on Facebook
about the 'Obama economy' and how it had affected his life. I don't doubt that
the Obama economy has affected many, but this man is assuredly not among them.
His status in life is directly attributable to the choices he's made, and his
life will improve only through better decisions. But for him to make better
choices, he needs to live in an environment that forces him to ask tough
questions about himself. There is a cultural movement in the white working
class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains
adherents by the day. Here is where the rhetoric of modern conservatives (and I
say this as one of them) fails to meet the real challenges of their biggest
constituents. Instead of encouraging engagement, conservatives increasingly
foment the kind of detachment that has sapped the ambition of so many of my
peers. I have watched some friends blossom into successful adults and others
fall victim to the worst of Middletown's temptations—premature parenthood,
drugs, incarceration. What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are
the expectations that they had for their own lives. Yet the message of the
right is increasingly: It's not your fault that you're a loser; it's the
government's fault.
</blockquote>
This feeling extends to the broader white working class. Arlie Russell
Hochschild called this feeling STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LAND:
<blockquote>
You are patiently standing in a long line leading up a hill, as in a pilgrimage.
You are situated in the middle of this line, along with others who are also
white, older, Christian, predominantly male, some with college degrees, some
not. Just over the brow of the hill is the American Dream, the goal of everyone
waiting in line . . . You've suffered long hours, layoffs, and exposure to
dangerous chemicals at work, and received reduced pensions. You have shown
moral character through trial by fire, and the American Dream of prosperity and
security is a reward for all of this, showing who you have been and are—a badge
of honor . . . Look! You see people cutting in line ahead of you! You're
following the rules. They aren't. As they cut in, it feels like you are being
moved back. How can they just do that? Who are they? Some are black. Through
affirmative action plans, pushed by the federal government, they are being
given preference for places in colleges and universities, apprenticeships,
jobs, welfare payments, and free lunches . . . Women, immigrants, refugees,
public sector workers—where will it end? Your money is running through a
liberal sympathy sieve you don't control or agree with . . . But it's people
like you who have made this country great. You feel uneasy. It has to be said:
the line cutters irritate you . . . You are a stranger in your own land. You do
not recognize yourself in how others see you. It is a struggle to feel seen and
honored . . .[Y]ou are slipping backward.
</blockquote>
It is this is feeling that found a voice in Trump in whom belated identification
has become hope, in whom anger has been given an authorized outlet. What's a
possible solution? I'm not qualified to offer one.

But strangers—Shipler also wrote a book about them, though through a racial
lens: A COUNTRY OF STRANGERS: BLACKS AND WHITES IN AMERICA. It was published
when I was 4, and I can still remember clearly the night of December 3, 1997
when my celestial glory, newspaper and coffee in hand, sat down in front of the
TV, eagerly waiting for him to appear on C-SPAN. Clinton, then president, was
holding a town hall to discuss race, and a recording is now available online.
The snippet I'm talking about is between 28:09 and 44:13, and this
<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?96122-1/town-meeting-race&start=1689">link</a>
defaults to its start. Shipler said:
<blockquote>
I feel that we're in a different phase of race relations in this country than we
used to be, and in some ways it's a more complicated phase. Bigotry, for the
most part, is not as blatant and obvious and outrageous as it used to be. A lot
of it has gone underground. It takes subtler forms, encrypted forms. Prejudice
is a shapeshifter. It's very agile in taking forms that seem acceptable on the
surface . . . I think for us as white Americans to understand some of this, we
have to reflect on some of the differences in experiences we've had as opposed
to those that Blacks and other minorities have had . . . I think in a dialogue
of this kind, the key is to listen, not just to talk . . . I'm hoping that if
we listen to each other, we can begin to diminish the size of that chasm and
perhaps even make this society of ours into less and less of a country of
strangers.
</blockquote>
Clinton added, "I don't think there is any legal policy answer to this. I think
this is something we've really got to work our way through." Beverly Daniel
Tatum was present too and said, "There's a lot of silence about these issues,
and I think breaking this silence is something many people are afraid of doing.
And as you pointed out we can't really fix this problem or continue the
improvement until we're able to engage in honest dialogue about that." On the
opposing side, Abigail Thernstrom, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a
conservative think tank, spoke about how far we've come since the 1960s and how
integrated the country had become. I think she meant well, but I think when you
pick certain data points, you can paint a better picture than how things are,
and relying on surveys for issues like race reveals less about outcomes and
behaviors than the prevailing fashionable attitudes of the time. When it's hot
out, it won't help to check the weather channel if your house is burning. Show
me your data, and I can show you segregation on a

doctors, like the entire sample, showed an implicit preference for [w]hite
Americans relative to Black Americans. We examined these effects among [w]hite,
African American, Hispanic, and Asian MDs and by physician gender. Strength of
implicit bias exceeded self-report among all test takers except African
American MDs.
</blockquote>
I can agree that by 1997 there had been progress compared to the 1960s,
according to the data that Thernstrom mentioned, but the message she's
conveying is that much progress had already been made, which begs the
question, "Why are people still worked up about this?", which leads to a
dangerous complacence. But an important thing to recognize is how in 1997 we
can sit down and talk about these things, disagreement or not. Two decades
later, how far have we come as a country? Anne Applebaum
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/milley-critical-race-theory-marxism-racism-fox-news/619308/">wrote</a>
in The Atlantic the importance of openness to ideas, starting with a class I was
vividly alive to be physically in:
<blockquote>
Back in the 1980s, comparative-literature majors at my university had to take a
required course in literary theory. This course—Lit 130, if memory
serves—offered prospective scholars a series of frames and theories that could
be applied to the reading of books . . . We suffered through a lot of turgid
academic writing, but the class had its uses. I learned, among other things,
that one can read the same text from multiple points of view and therefore see
different themes in it. When a Marxist reads Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice,
for example, he might become interested in the way in which wealth, power, and
the determination to have both shapes the lives of all of the characters. When
a feminist reads the same book, she might discover that patriarchal attitudes
toward women, who are judged and valued for their marriageability, shape the
lives of the characters too. The Freudians, as you might surmise, would notice
a whole different set of motifs . . . In his congressional testimony last week,
General Mark Milley endorsed the underlying philosophy of Lit 130, which also
happens to be the underlying philosophy of a liberal education: Read widely;
listen to everybody; make your own judgment about what's important. Here is how
he put it: 'I do think it's important actually for those of us in uniform to be
open-minded and be widely read.' The phrase widely read means that you can and
should read things you disagree with. You can definitely read Marx without
becoming a Marxist. You can read critical race theory without becoming
a 'critical race theorist,' however you define that . . . You can also read
American history in this same spirit, the way you would read a great piece of
literature, seeking to understand the complexities and the nuances, the dark
and the light, the good and the bad. You can be inspired by the Declaration of
Independence, horrified by the expulsions of Native Americans, amazed by the
energy of immigrants and frontier settlers. You can understand that the United
States is a great and unique country whose values are worth defending—and
realize simultaneously that this same country has made terrible mistakes and
carried out horrific crimes. Is it so difficult to hold all of these disparate
ideas in your head at the same time?
</blockquote>
Applebaum then critiques those on both extremes, the rabid critical race
theorists who can't tolerate dissidents and the far right that refuses to deign
even a nod to critical race theory:
<blockquote>
Soldiers should know, Milley declared, that African Americans were counted as
less than fully human until 'we had a civil war and Emancipation Proclamation
to change it.' It took 'another 100 years,' he noted, to get to the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. All of that should sound completely uncontroversial. It's
just a recitation of facts about American history, things that most people
learn in elementary school. But to Fox News's Tucker Carlson, the mere
suggestion that you should seek to understand your own society, including its
flaws, makes you a 'pig' and 'stupid.' Laura Ingraham, another Fox News host,
called for defunding the military in response to Milley's statements, on the
grounds that 'he's chosen to indulge the radical whims of Democrats.' The
Carlsons, Ingrahams, and other culture warriors who now dominate the world of
conservative infotainment seem now to believe that the study of American
history—the knowledge of what actually happened on the territory that lies
between the two shining seas—should be forbidden. The Republican-controlled
state legislatures and school boards that are currently seeking to ban the
teaching of 'critical race theory' have this same intention . . . But there is
another kind of person who might dislike Milley's attitude. Critical race
theory is not the same thing as Marxism, but some of its more facile
popularizers share with Marxists the deep conviction that their way of seeing
the world is the only way worth seeing the world. Moreover, some have
encouraged people to behave as if this were the only way of seeing the world.
The structural racism that they have identified is real, just as the class
divisions once identified by the Marxists were real. But racism is not
everywhere, in every institution, or in every person's heart at all times. More
to the point, any analysis of American history or American society that sees
only structural racism will misunderstand the country, and badly. It will not
be able to explain why the U.S. did in fact have an Emancipation Proclamation,
a Civil Rights Act, a Black president. This is a major stumbling block, not so
much for the legal scholars (some of whom actually merit the title 'critical
race theorist') but rather for the popularizers and the
scholars-turned-activists who want to force everybody to recite the same
mantras.
</blockquote>
Listen to both sides! What a great idea that seems to come from common sense!

And what is the racialized experience like? Step back to 1992, when I, then -1
years old, frolicking in the ether and couldn't wait to materialize, about
thirty years before George Floyd's murder drew national attention, Jane
Elliott
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebPoSMULI5U">ran</a>
her brown eye/blue eye experiment, which reverses the direction of
discrimination, on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The video is half an hour long. If
you are white and are too uncomfortable to watch it to the end, how do you
suppose you can understand the many for whom this experience is America's
reality that the country has decided not to see? For people of color, they
would find in Jane the voice of grievance that working class whites have found
in Trump. Indeed, the experience of watching this video breaks through the
simple, naive, token emotions of one-dimensional happiness and joy of popular,
commercialized entertainment and touches briefly something of the heights of
literature, which is that humor and rage, truth and tragedy, mania and sanity,
life and its passing, are all one and the same.

When working class whites have been positioned at the front line to combat
others who have been historically oppressed, when neither group owns any
significant share of the country's wealth, is it not then obvious who is
fanning the flames? I don't think some mastermind is orchestrating some
conspiracy, but that those who live in everyday insecurity, when aggravated,
fall into a competition to get ahead of each other, and those who are more
privileged stand guard over their own possessions as they watch the chaos
unfold, laying out a narrative that even touching a fraction of the millions or
billions in their portfolios which they do not use stifles progress and
innovation or pushes the country towards socialism, when they clutch their
purses and think, "What business is it of mine to step in?"

Even with Trump out of office,
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/29/a-partisan-chasm-in-views-of-trumps-legacy/ft_21-03-24_trump_legacy_feelings_new1/">views</a>
on him have largely remained unchanged among Democrats and Republicans, and what
we will have in coming elections is more of the same contention, polarization,
and distrust across parties because the underlying issues of inequality remain,
susceptible to dirty marketing tactics by unscrupulous politicans more
interested in their lining their pockets than running a government. The trend,
however, is that younger generations are more liberal according to
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/030118_o_5/">this</a>

to changing traditions, and the Congress that entered office this year is
already more
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/10/the-changing-face-of-congress/">diverse</a>
in race, gender, and religion.
A
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/coming-generation-war/588670/">projection</a>
indicates that by 2039, Gen Z and Millenials will consist of nearly 70%
self-identifying Democrats. Given these trends, it may not be too off the mark
to claim: if the country manages to not descend into civil war, then politics
in the next decades, whoever the next Trumpist demagogue is in 2024 and
thereafter, will resemble the stock market, waves of short-term volatility as
distractions to the inevitable trajectory towards progress when the younger
generations, more open, more tolerant, more willing to fix problems and move
forward, constitute growing shares of the electorate.

Yet progress of this kind poses another problem to a healthy democracy when it
turns into a one-party monopoly. The victory at the top also comes with the
isolation of not having a sparring partner of equal standing. What will become
of the Republican Party? How will conservative populism evolve to confront the
problems of modernity when it can no longer appeal to a declining constituency
invigorated by toxic bravado, narrow-minded calls to a past era that is not
returning, smokescreening actual issues by yelling, "Look at those evil people
changing things!", instead of constructive solutions. How will the new platform
of the Republican party mitigate the dawn of a glamorous new serfdom at Apple
Park, Zuckerberg Park, and Bezos Park with equitable job growth, balance the
tax rate of less than
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">4%</a>
among the 25 richest Americans and a certain
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html">politician</a>
who has a history of avoiding taxes with HILLBILLY ELEGY, THE WORKING POOR, and
HARVEST OF SHAME, while also addressing climate change instead of thinking it a
hoax? How much is ExxonMobil paying you?

And what will happen to the Democratic Party once its principal opponent fades
into something of the past? Will its coalition that put itself together, each
group advancing its own interests by absorbing its neighbors', held into one by
intolerable, toxic fumes coming out of the other side's pulpit, break into
foolish fragments as predictable as human nature, white women prioritizing
white women, Blacks voting for Blacks, Asians for Asians, Hispanics for
Hispanics, and white men, caught between race and gender, choose race and side
with white women? The results from last week's NYC Democratic mayoral primary
suggest just this kind of racial delineation. Putting the candidates' proposed
policies aside, a neighborhood's voter preference strongly resembles its racial
composition. The Times released an interactive district-level
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/23/nyregion/nyc-mayor-primary-results-precinct-map.html">map</a>
of how the city voted, which can be compared with a map of the city's racial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_York_City&oldid=1030916027#/media/File:Race_and_ethnicity_2010-_New_York_City_(5559914315).png">distribution</a>
Manhattan's core, predominantly white, voted for Kathryn Garcia. The Asian
neighborhoods, and oddly also the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Borough Park,
voted for Andrew Yang. And Harlem, the Bronx, and large swaths of Queens and
Brooklyn, in the Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, voted for Eric Adams or Maya
Wiley. I don't think these results are a coincidence, and if this is a
precursor to what will happen to the Democratic Party, then perhaps all one can
do is shrug in disappointment. If you say race is not a problem and you are
white, let me know again when I point out that the
<a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/children-are-at-the-forefront-of-u-s-racial-and-ethnic-change/">minorities</a>
of today will soon no longer be minorities and that Christianity, even
considered as the sum of its denominations, may very well not be the
predominant

for much longer. This is the inconvenient problem of race, not as discriminatory
racism which also needs to be addressed, but as the country's identity shift.
Perhaps fortunately, this is a problem of time, and the free solution is the
passing of the decades, when the younger generations have already been slowly
acclimating to the changing face of America which in a gradual shift will not
seem out of the ordinary, like eyes seeing their reflection every morning but
don't notice the wrinkles accumulating on the face. If you say race is not a
problem and you are not white, consider what will happen when white Hispanics
start voting like whites, Blacks push for expanding affirmative action, Asians
insist on maintaining policing. What will become of race then? Time will tell,
but perhaps it'll only be a problem when people remain walled up in
self-interested isolation, but why not be spurred by the idea of trying
something new? Why not? How many in the American heartland still conceive of
New York as just the one in the past as sung by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrUfJW1JGk">Sinatra</a>
without also realizing there's also the modern ones by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsZlY0Vz4-o">Jay-Z</a>
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHKXYWZYH5E">Alicia Keys</a>?

Back to the present. I'll end this section on politics with

of how each party feels about the other. It reads like a dysfunctional
relationship. Their words, not mine, but the Republican views I disagree with
are the ones that have no easy compromise and ones I don't think are promising
to address because they existed even before the current hysterical
polarization, distrust, cancel culture, and utter lack of communication between
parties, and which are not the cause of the country's intolerance towards the
other side but which only seem exacerbated because of growing economic
imbalance, when one side is naively scapegoating in a rapidly changing
demographic and the other stings with unaddressed racial and gender
inequalities. These issues are: abortion, gun rights, implementing religion
values in the law, and whether the Constitution should be adapted to the modern
country and not remain catered to the one two hundred years ago. I'll also take
the liberty to add that two hundred years ago was when people weren't able to
buy assault rifles, when slavery was legal and the original text
proclaimed, "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
several States which may be included within this Union, according to their
respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of
free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and
excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons"—until one
century later when an amendment repealed such nonsense.

<h4>2021-04-04, 日. On Religion and Roger Scruton.</h4>
I'm an atheist, and today's post situates my views in the context of religion,
and why the religion question largely doesn't matter.

First, I will state some of my doubts. To even begin to convince me to believe
in God, you must answer this question of mine: why Jesus or Yahweh or Allah when
I can also choose Zeus and Hera, Shiva and Brahma, Isis and Osiris, Odin and
Ymir, Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl, Ababinili and Agu'gux, Hadad and Anu?
Why one god and not four hundred? Would God have been the next titular character
had Joseph Campbell extended his HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES? I can't shake off
the observation that those who are religious are religious because of a sense of
community and not because they are wholly convinced from first principles in the
existence of God. To convince me to be religious is to show me that faith is not
just the happenstance religion of the society into which we are born, assigned
at birth and immured as the sole option when we are too young to resist our
parents and our friends, too young to think and doubt, too young to realize that
by adulthood we will be too accustomed to holding on to faith out of nominal
identification with that community and not out of true belief.

I'm not speaking of religion in the way Alan Watts did when he used a marketing
ploy to slip God under the cover of mesmerizing rhetoric. The God he spoke of
was not the omnipotent deity of the Judeo-Christian tradition but a god
embedded in the personal and everyday, everywhere and needing no more worship
than a spiritual awareness. What a great cheat! How he committed the
intellectual laziness of conflating one god with another by using the same
terminology! The notion of God is too loosely defined. Do we agree with
Maimonides when he explained that the Jewish God is such a perfect unity that
he could not be described in any positive sense, and we cannot say God has arms
or legs, or that God is omnipotent, or that God has thoughts, for any such
statement limits the greatness of God? Surely one can follow this description
as one can follow a thought experiment, but no one can persuade me away from my
immediate thought: what a wonderful fiction!—though such a character is
certainly too dull for my book.

To live motivated by the thought that disorderly conduct towards your fellow men
earns you a one-way ticket to eternal condemnation seems to me immensely
self-centered because such a guiding principle suggests we have an eye towards
our own fates when we choose how to behave  towards others, and that propriety
is not a self-evident principle derivable from common sense and reason. How low
does this suggest of us and our fellow men that we can't be decent without fear
of punishment? Bertrand Russell wrote, "Religion, since it has its source in
terror, has dignified certain kinds of fear, and made people think them not
disgraceful. In this it has done mankind a great disservice: all fear is bad. I
believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive. I am
not young, and I love life. But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the
thought of annihilation. Happiness is none the less [sic] true happiness
because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value
because they are not everlasting. Many a man has borne himself proudly on the
scaffold; surely the same pride should teach us to think truly about a man's
place in the world. Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver
after the cosy indoor warmth of traditional humanising myths, in the end the
fresh air brings out vigour, and the great spaces have a splendour of their
own." One can enter the sublime by sitting in church in the front pew, enjoying
Bach's music playing under the towering apse just as one can enter it by lying
back on the open grass, under the constellations of the night sky, all on one's
own, contemplating  the stars whence one came; one can be spiritual without a
god. Humanity's pursuits—reaching for transcendence, enjoying music, living
virtuously, seeking meaning and purpose—what does God have to do with them?
Everything we've done, we've done without Him.

The most compelling argument for believing in God I've come across is Roger
Scruton's. Scruton did not dodge the hard questions, did not consider his views
an obvious truth, was not intolerant to conflicting views, and was not so
deluded in his own beliefs that he couldn't accommodate cross-examination.
During an interview he was asked, "God. We got rid of Him, finally. We finally
recognized we are totally alone in the universe. Oceans of time before us,
oceans of time after us—Schopenhauer—yeah? And amidst we are, giving meaning to
our lives, just one little second in eternity. And now you're coming up with God
again. In three or four minutes you're talking about a <i>moral</i> God." The
interviewer continued: "If we see our presence in the universe at this very
moment in time for 60 or 70 or 80 years as one whisper, and we can't give
meaning to our own lives because there are no preconditions, there is no God,
there is no moral statement in the universe itself, of the universe itself.
Isn't that more challenging than returning to the old idea of a moral God?"
Taken aback for a second from so direct a question, Scruton replied: "If you
want to live your life being challenged, that's fine. There are lots of things
more challenging than my worldview, but it doesn't follow they're for that
reason more true. It's possible for someone like Rilke to live with a kind of
death of God feeling, to say to himself, 'For God has been taken from the world,
along with so much else. I will now remake everything according to my own inner
light and find consolation there.' And to some extent, that's what I do, but not
everybody is Rilke. Most people, deprived of this kind of consolation, don't
rise to the challenge at all. They sink a long way beneath it, and they live
without that aspiration to be something better that they would otherwise have
had. And so I'm very much opposed to taking this sort of thing away from people.
If you lose it yourself, then of course that could be regarded as a misfortune,
or you might regard it a great liberation, as Nietzsche tried to do. But that's
your problem. You deal with it. I have my own way of dealing with it, and I
think I have dealt with it. I worked my way back to something, not really the
God of organized religion, but I worked my way back to something like a God
idea. I'm giving it a place in my life which enables me to stand to some extent
in judgment of myself, as I think I should." Fair enough. This answer satisfies
me, and I can respect Scruton for it. The necessary consequence, of course, is
that Scruton thinks we were both created in the image of God and that I have
fallen from favor, while I think his belief in an unprovable deity ludicrous. No
further word can be said that can change our minds, but this doesn't matter
because the thwarted conversation is postponed until the infinitude that comes
after the day when both of us are dead, when, as far as we're concerned,
everything ceases to matter. I may not agree with Scruton's views, but I can
respect him for adequately examining his convictions and living by them to the
very end.

I am not Richard Dawkins. I don't impose atheism on anyone. Freedom of religion
is one of the founding principles of the country. If you are religious, be
satsfied in your community, and I mine, which proclaims: We have no god to love,
and no god loves us, we do not believe in deities whose business it is to lord
over our miniscule lives, for we believe not in gods but in humanity. I can find
the religiously devout among those I consider at the pinnacle of humanity:
Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, William Blake, just as I can find among
them atheists. My gripe is not against religion itself but the lack of the
necessary search and labor to convince oneself beyond, "It's what everyone
around me believes, and we fear those who don't."

In America, we have a party that knows it is losing power and instead of a
graceful handover and adapting to the times, it resorts to pathetic measures
like gerrymandering and restricting the voting rights of Americans who are not
on their side, the whole party patently struggling to hold on to dear life. I
can respect Scruton, but I can't respect the whole line of Republican senators
who ride on disinformation, sending the wrong message to working class Americans
to vote against their interests so the rich can have lower taxes, those
Republicans who sell religious and national purity like Mitch McConnell—whose
wife happens to be Chinese and who is responsible for his wealth—and Ted Cruz,
and their predecessor William Buckley who would have rather resorted to lies
and elitism rather than accept progress. Why all the opposition to change?
Martin Luther posting his NINETY-FIVE THESES on a church's door sounds pretty
radical. A group of 102 religious pilgrims seeking religious freedom sailing on
the Mayflower to a new, largely unknown continent sounds pretty radical. The
French Revolution sounds pretty radical. This is the pattern of human
civilization: today's radical is tomorrow's past, as certain and unyieldable as
the iron law of history. As Schopenhauer put it, "All truth passes through three
stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is
accepted as being self-evident." For the logical among us, think of it this way:
jump forward on the timeline and look back; today's radicalism is already in the
past. This is not to say all change is progress. Marxism, Nazism, Communism,
Fascism, anarchy, populism, nuclear fallout, and nativism are not avenues of
progress. Progress is determined by what works as a push forward for humanity,
not by self-interest, power-mongering, greed, and blinkered nationalism.

The remainder of this post discusses Scruton. In considering my differences
against Scruton, I can't help but also notice the immense similarities, and I
recall Schopenhauer's  world as illusion, world as appearance, reality as but a
surface veneer. Schopenhauer took this idea from the ancient Vedic tradition,
which also had so inspired Hesse that one of his recurring projects was an
attempt to reconcile the West's dilemma between rationality and the animal
within against India's amorphous nature of reality. Peel away our differences—he
a conservative and I a liberal, his Christianity and my atheism, his British
reserve, stiff upper lip, preoccupation with dignity,  ever aspiring to serenity
and order, and my fearless charge towards intensity, passion, flame, grabbing
life by the horns, he who returns ever again to equilibrium when I say, "Why
bother resting? After this brief stint, we have all eternity for
equilibrium"—and there is more  in Scruton that I can respect not only because
of his unmitigated journey towards authenticity, but because the underlying
ideas guiding the way he lived his life are also mine.

Scruton defended Heidegger's notion of dwelling as "this attempt to reaffirm
with your connection with a particular place at a particular time and a
particular social web . . . Every serious idea is dangerous. In a civilized mind
it is not. It is an instrument of peace. I'm talking about peaceful existence in
a single place, an unthreatening form of being"—Scruton not only agrees with
this as an intellectual idea but lived by it. Scruton expands on this idea with
Hegel's homecoming spirit: "In all of us there is a desire for homecoming, where
we find ourselves having ventured out into all these dangerous experiments of
individual living, at last coming back, swallowing all our pride, and humbly
acquiescing in a social order which is bigger than ourselves." In these words
Scruton also captured the trajectory of his life, as he recounted his early
years: "I was very fortunate in having an unhappy childhood so that my desire
from the very beginning was to escape from it . . . I was very much aware of the
difference between me and everybody else, that there was something in me that
needed to be addressed. I had a question in my life. I didn't know what the
question was, but I knew that it needed an answer, and I had first to identify
what the question was. So the things that my contemporaries took pleasure in,
like football, cinema, whatever it might be, pop music, had very little
significance for me, even though like all my contemporaries of course I played
the guitar, a bit of bass guitar, and all the usual—things one had to do. But
even while doing it I regarded myself just as ridiculous as the people around
me." It was only later that Scruton gradually came upon how to pose the
question: "Someone like Heidegger would say it was the question of Being. What
and why am I? What is this soul doing in this environment, and how can  it
possibly come to be in that environment in a way that will bring peace to
itself?" In middle age, Scruton described his fear of choosing to abandon his
position as a professor as "being afraid to give up a career that I thought to
be certain and secure, but I knew that I should give it up because it was not
me, my career as a teacher. I finally got the courage to give it up, but I left
it very late." And in describing the broader fear of living, Scruton said, "When
you're confronted with this sort of fear, you might run from it into false
consolations, things which are not real consolations because they involve no
overcoming . . . I can see what it would be to take refuge in wine completely,
and allow that to soothe one through one's day and to soothe one through one's
inadequacies, to enable one to put this fear to one side.  That is not a
consolation. A consolation to me comes from having confronted trouble, and
eliciting from the heart of the trouble the resolution of it." Scruton examines
himself in the way of someone who has the habit of doing deep reflection: "I
have always worked very hard at my literary gifts, but in every direction
they've suggested, philosophical essays, fiction, anything that seems to come to
my pen, but it's always been enormous work, and I've always connected it
deliberately with my subjectivity, the peculiar confusion which I inherited by
being born the thing that I was. And I made them slaves, my literary works, of
my need, and each of them had the task of unraveling this confusion . . . except
for a few academic articles, all this has been a completely personal voyage of
discovery . . . so this was a very personal thing, which had nothing to do with
the normal <i>Bildung</i> of a normal academic philosopher. My life was a kind
of <i>Bildungsroman</i> in which the academic part was a sort of continuous and
enjoyable mistake. I shouldn't have been a teacher, or I shouldn't have been
locked away in libraries. My heart and soul have always been in other things,
I've always been involved in other things, which have always been more important
to feeding what I really think."

Scruton's first marriage failed, but his second marriage, at 52, to Sophie
Jeffreys, after a "slow, quiet, respectful courtship," not in the searing
passion of uninhibited romance but in the quaint charm, quiet serenity,
coquettish allure, and mutual attraction hidden beneath preserved dignity so apt
to the British manner, lasted until his death. Scruton composed a piece for the
piano dedicated to his wife "which would convey something of her composure and
orderliness." He called it BOREAS BLOWS NOT, referencing Herodotus: "Boreas
blows not through the young virgin who lives alone in the house with her mother.
Because at the time, Sophie was living alone in her house with her mother. So it
was a description of Boreas the north wind refusing to blow, or unable to blow,
through this secure little cottage." Scruton made for himself and his wife a
version of this little cottage, with a yard in the front for the horses he kept
for fox-hunting. In his cottage in the countryside of Wiltshire, on a plot of
land he bought that he named Scrutopia, Scruton lived out his years with his
wife among books lining the walls and a grand piano in the center of the living
room. True to his word, Scruton dwelled, playing Bach in his village's church
every Sunday. Scruton dwelled, returning to the countryside into which he was
born: "My childhood was in a semi-detached house by a railway line in which we
were, you know, very poor, very much living in the old class resentment of the
English . . . It has nothing to do with this. This here is created by books and
music in the middle of a countryside which I love and among people doing
innocent old-fashioned things with animals. That's as far as one can get." In
Wiltshire, Scruton lived until his death in January 2020. May he rest in the
peace of eternity that I too will one day join, hopefully having attained the
same peace in human terms.

<h4>2021-02-11, 四. On Race, Diversity, and Immigration.</h4>
Today's post is delicate for obvious reasons. Reader be warned, this may make
you more uncomfortable than my other posts, but this is an important issue to
explore.<br>
___

Let's cast aside the political polarization for a moment and have a mature
conversation on race and the future identity of America. It's not popular these
days but I don't think it's inherently racist to talk about race and its
practical consequences, from both perspectives: the white's and the person of
color's. There are very real issues that have to be addressed. The recent rise
of neo-Nazies, conspiracy theories, and white supremacism is not possible under
a well-functioning democracy. It only happens when people are insecure and under
threat, and this threat stems from 1) poor white folks who feel the country has
forgotten them and 2) the rapid demographic changes are altering the country's
identity. I have nothing insightful to say about the first reason on top of the
obvious need to address the problem. This post addresses the second reason.

<b>Discontent</b>

Here are the facts.
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/03/14/the-us-will-become-minority-white-in-2045-census-projects/">Estimates</a>
project that the country will become majority non-white in 2045. It's very soon—
I'll likely still be alive when it happens. What do whites, who are losing
representation, think of this? A
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/03/21/views-of-demographic-changes-in-america/">survey</a>
found nearly as many view it positively (26%) as negatively (28%).

I'd like to first write a bit with the 28% in mind. At the extreme is the
far-right. Richard Spencer, Lauren Southern, and Gavin McInnes are saying, "We
built the wealthiest nation on Earth, we introduced democracy and defended it,
we created a free state for all, we created the modern world, and who are these
foreigners coming over and stealing our inheritance from us?" This is indeed the
reality, and I have to say, they have a point. There's a conversation to be had,
certainly not one I can settle but let's examine this further. My view in the
end is that resources, opportunities, and equitable values should not be hoarded
within lines as arbitrary as race.

It's worth repeating: I don't think it's racist to talk about whites wishing to
preserve Western civilization. It's a matter of defensive self-conservation. The
far right is the loudest but in today's intolerance that's the only venue to
voice this defensive stance. Again I don't think this is racist but their
concern is they're being pushed out. I read this from somewhere online—to my
fellow liberals, this might be useful to see where the right is coming
from—consider a white person moving to China and demanding that Chinese culture
be moved aside, that the Chinese should lose rights for racial equality, and
that the Chinese should be disarmed and have no option to push back. It's not
racist but such actions provoke self-defense even by a neutral bystander. The
question is whether it's fair to believe the dominant culture of the country
(white culture) would be happy becoming just another minority group and losing
the power it's had since the country's inception. I'd like to believe so because
the way forward for the country is to accommodate all Americans but I suspect
many white folks, openly or privately, don't—specifically the 28% in the survey
who didn't even bother pretending. The question isn't about equality. The
country's changing racial demographics is like saying: imagine a Britain that's
not predominantly British or a China that's not predominantly Chinese. And no
matter our skin color, if any of us takes a stroll along the Seine in Paris and
see more Muslims in hijabs than the original French, does Paris feel French?
This is the unsettling reality. Suppose for a moment that we lifted every poor
white American out of poverty and secured their future prospects. Even then,
would they be happy with no longer being able to identify with what the country
is becoming? Conservatives feel their homeland is being hijacked even while we
progressives see inequality at every turn. It's a problem in Europe too with the
Syrian refugee crisis. Whiteness, Christianity, and the European identity that
built the country are being threatened and what we're doing is blanket-blocking
any mention of it as racist when there's a valid point here.

This problem extends to academia. A very recent vanguard in the humanities has
essentially been saying: "we" have been oppressed, colonialized,
underrepresented, and now that we're empowered we're going to take what's ours
and air our dirty laundry. I'm not saying their push for equality is wrong but
that they leave no room for the other side in a climate of cancel culture. Think
of all the academics whose entire careers are based on what is now blatantly
called imperialist and colonialist. The premise of the country as a free state
where all are equal is not possible when we are separating ourselves into
piecemeal subcultures defending our turf. America cannot be an either/or but has
to be an inclusive both/and. Among many other adjustments, the required
coursework reading may very well have to change from the exclusively white
Western canon and the field may need some serious reflection on its context and
history, but this doesn't mean dissolving the discipline, as Dan-el Padilla
Peralta is open to doing with the classics. Let's recall that even ideas as
radically departing from traditional Western perspective as those in Edward
Said's ORIENTALISM didn't call for destroying the whole field.

What is happening is human nature: everyone pursues his interest, and it is the
country that plays mediator for all citizens. Can we each stop demonizing the
other side? It is useful to keep in mind John Rawls' veil of ignorance and take
a step back from our particular place in society to think larger. With America
soon to become majority non-white, we have to make peace with that fact. Now,
onto something more interesting.

<b>Towards a Brighter Future</b>

This is sobering: a
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376654">study</a>
last year found that when people are forming teams and adding members, they
deliberately reduce diversity when they are shown whether a potential member
boosts or drops the team's overall diversity. This behavior looms large.
For all we tout diversity in our public relations messaging, for all the
apparent diversity in cities, residential neighborhoods are largely segregated
by race, even in our most diverse cities:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127082921/www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-Urban-Research/CUR-research-initiatives/The-End-of-Segregation-Hardly">New York City</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210915084136/belonging.berkeley.edu/racial-segregation-san-francisco-bay-area-part-1">San Francisco</a>,
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210115210129/today.uic.edu/new-report-details-chicagos-racial-ethnic-disparities/">Chicago</a>.
And this
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211229001323/http://racialdotmap.demographics.coopercenter.org/">map</a>
shows the race distribution in the country using the 2010 census data, with one
dot per person, each dot colored by race. This is the undeniable state of
affairs: de facto segregation. Residential segregation translates to school
segregation.
<a href="https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/30098/why-have-americas-public-schools-gotten-more-racially-segregated">These</a>
maps show segregation consistent with the country's racialized geography, and
this is over half a century after <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.
Whatever image of a racially integrated country we may have in mind is not just
overly optimistic but entirely wrong. PRRI
<a href="https://www.prri.org/research/poll-race-religion-politics-americans-social-networks/">surveyed</a>
racial compositions in 2013 of social networks within racial groups and
revealed shocking homogenity. Among whites, 91% of friends are also white,
among Blacks, 83% are Black, and among Hispanics, 64% are Hispanic. And Asians?
No data for us. We're invisible. But these numbers remind me of Beverly
Daniel Tatum's WHY ARE ALL THE BLACK KIDS SITTING TOGETHER? because of its
title and how it cuts at the core of the matter. What is disheartening is I have
not even the slightest instinct to say these numbers are out of touch with
reality. What about the entertainment we consume? A
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/61/2/369/4098571">study</a>
found "[w]hite participants showed significantly less interest in seeing movies
with mostly Black casts than in seeing movies with mostly [w]hite casts."
Another
<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1996-05-02-1996123149-story.html">study</a>
found that whites and Blacks have few favorite TV shows in common.
And books? I couldn't find a study on this, but let's be honest. If we can't
even bring ourselves to watch movies and TV across race, how many do we suppose
have read James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, or Toni Morrison? Or Zadie Smith, Salman
Rushdie, Orhan Pamuk?

So we don't live together, don't go to the same schools, aren't friends with
each other, don't watch the same movies or TV shows, and if we meet each other
at work what guides our conversations is a societal restraint from broaching
race that precludes any serious discussion and mingling. How then are we to make
friends across racial lines if we don't have much in common, can't point out the
obvious, and skirt about the issue by talking shop, and when we invite that
friend to our circle of largely homogenous friends we are also transferring the
burden of restraint to them? And what are we talking about when we say with such
conviction that we understand the Black plight or that of other minorities who
have been less abused and less disenfranchised over the course of the country's
history if the immensity of our unquestioned confidence comes from—indeed
betrays—our own realities, our projected mythologies and imaginations exchanged
among friends, cloistered in our communities where everyone looks and thinks
like ourselves?

Racial inequality is something we can't help but pick up on. We adults don't
talk about it because we've learned restraint, afraid of saying the wrong thing,
and instead keep quiet or look away. Kids notice it too but are more open to
speaking their minds. In the podcast NICE WHITE PARENTS, the host Chana
Joffe-Walt describes this kind of situation when white students, who bring more
funding power, started enrolling at a predominantly Black and Hispanic middle
school: "These boys, even at 11 years old, they've absorbed the same messages
that [the school] wasn't so good before. It was a bad school. He and his
friends, they've turned the school around. That's what he's learning." This is
what the boy in question said: "The kids wouldn't pay attention. And they had,
like--got to, like, zone out every little thing. And I bet they learned very
little. And now this generation with us, I think we're doing a lot better. And I
think that we're learning at a much faster pace." This comment isn't racist so
much as it's an innocent observation of a consequence of our education system
and a history of suppression, and what he is saying is something we all notice
when we come across it, but the current political and social climate casts over
us a pall that mutes what we already know as wise silence.

Here I digress to put in a word on immigration. Like any proper New Yorker, I am
a flaming liberal. I support the idea of equal opportunity for all whether in
this country or in any other. In spite of this, I don't think the answer to the
immigration question is to throw open our doors and let everyone in. There is a
limit to how many the country can tolerate without bankrupting the social
system. David Frum
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/">notes</a>
the practical concerns of immigration, that immigrants cost the
government more than they contribute in taxes. A part of me says this is the
price of an egalitarianism, but this deficit also surfaces a brutal reality. How
can we accommodate indefinitely more immigrants when our country is already
steep in debt and millions of our own, those we look in the eye as our fellow
Americans, are struggling? Frum advocates focusing our immigration policy to
accept highly skilled immigrants—doctors and engineers—who earn their keep and
help the country remain innovative. This, of course, means a continual brain
drain from their home countries, which strangely enough has been found to
increase wages and democratic values back home. I'm not convinced, however, that
losing a nation's best and brightest helps a developing country stand on its own
and catch up rather than merely benefiting indirectly from Western progress. But
this is the price of supplying American innovation, securing American
well-being.

Diversity—why is it so difficult? I'm an atheist, yet I've sat with a Protestant
as he prayed for me, I've linked hands with Catholics saying grace before a
meal, I've attended Mass, I've sat in classes full of Catholics. I've joined the
Muslim retreat at the Blue Mosque as the muezzin called and witnessed the hall's
worshipers kneeling on the floor in prayer. I put on a kippah in Jerusalem and
stood face-to-face with the Wailing Wall. I sat among the local community in
Mumbai at a Hindu engagement ceremony. So what that I'm an atheist? We should
keep in mind that what feels foreign to one is home to another, and it was the
arbitrary slight of chance that we ourselves were not born into another's
community.

Diversity is the country's future, and it is a future when the landscape of
writers and directors will have changed, along with the TV-watching and
movie-going market whose preference commands what the entertainment industry
produces. One day, this era's fight for social justice, equal representation,
true equality under law and its enforcement, will have been but one chapter in
the transition to a more equitable world. And one day, we will not think it out
of the ordinary that a lead actor is brown though we notice it and are aware of
the long struggle that made such casting possible, and we will not be
uncomfortable watching a person of color rejoice or sulk or have the full range
of experiences of any ordinary human. One day, the unsightly practice will have
passed when the camera deigns a moment for the diversity shot and then cuts
away, returning to the default whiteness. The country's future is mixed, and we
have to accept this as a reality, not boil over with veiled resentment.

William Buckley wrote, "A conservative is someone who stands athwart history,
yelling Stop." What nonsense. How shortsighted is his view of history that for
him, history extends no further than the past several hundred years since the
Great Divergence that marked the West's emergence as the world's wealthiest and
most advanced civilization, and he happened to have lived in the period when
such self-flattery is possible. The one constant that endures time is change,
and just as no individual lives forever in his youthful peak, no society is
immune to its evolving fortunes. How many came before who met worse fates have
had to accept change? Russians, Indians, Chinese, Persians, Turks, Aztecs,
Egyptians, and all those who belonged to once thriving civilizations: if it is
any consolation, others have been here before, and the decline of white power
in America is one peaceful tick of change in the ocean of our inflated
self-importance. How many in those prior civilizations screamed that the end is
nigh, yet the world has moved on, and they carry about themselves in it as
routinely as the earth revolves around the sun? It's always irked me how any
mentioning the fall of the Roman Empire carries an air of puritanical
nationalism, that it is with resentful resignation that such greatness came to
an end. It certainly was great, but we give the invaders who brought its fall
the exceedingly flattering name of barbarians even though they too had families
and lives, pursuing their interests just as the Romans theirs, and these
barbaric tribes don't seem barbarians any longer when we name them properly:
the Franks settling in modern France, the Visigoths in modern Spain, the
ancestors of the moderns. We sympathize so intensely with the Romans because we
see only one side, and the fact that we continue to use the word barbarians
descends from this lineage—it's what the Romans called outsiders. It is worth
reminding ourselves the truth Carl Sagan pointed out in COSMOS: "National
boundaries are not evident when we view the earth from space. Fanatical ethnic
or religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain when we
see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous
point of light against the bastion and citadel of the stars." That blue
crescent formed 4,500,000,000 years ago, of which we humans developed
agriculture in the last 12,000 and began laying the foundation for
civilization. It is outright foolish to think that human culture has peaked and
should change no further. The future of the country is diversity and what must
happen: acceptance and unity, not separation and exclusion. Why not imagine a
future where we contain Whitman's multitudes? Across canyons and valleys, lush
green praries and eroded rock strewn over sand-blown desert, towering mesas and
redwood forests, we find small towns and major metropolises decorating the land
under the snow-capped mountains, for we are all of us American: brown and
yellow and black and white and blue and red, bound not by prescriptions of the
isolated echo chambers that came before but by a full forward march, hand in
hand, towards a history that will bear our names in pioneering pride. When we
were children we saw ourselves as adventurers and explorers, looking out at a
world full of mystery, curious at everything, unafraid to learn, elated to be
alive. Where has that sense of awe and wonder gone?

<h4>2021-02-09, 二. In Defense of Abstract Art.</h4>
Why view abstract art? When we stand before an abstract painting, what is it
that we're looking at in the indeterminate swirls that don't even remotely
resemble a person, a place, or anything familiar? I wish to address why I prefer
abstraction.

If we can represent nature by reducing it into a set of equations, why not too
visual expression into art's purest form? And what is visual art on the canvas
but the strokes of a brush painting in the four variables of color, shape, size,
and space? Consider Mondrian, Rothko, and Kandinsky. They use these variables to
their own vision, and even with such a small arsenal, how can we say their
compositions are anything but wholly unlike each other? It is often mentioned
that abstract paintings lack technical difficulty. To this I say that the
difficulty of abstraction is in the conception which requires a certain
maturity, not in the elitist sense, but in the capacity to grasp symbolism to
its devastating potential. One way to conceive of the world is to view nature
and the universe as the eternal constants in which we measly humans flicker by,
but another, equally valid one is to place ourselves at the central vantage
point because what will it all have mattered if we don't exist? To appreciate
abstraction is to take the leap from merely mimicking reality, scrupulously
copying down its concretized distinctions and its various shades of light, to
human expression, the crux of what it means to be alive.

I remember the first time I encountered Barnett Newman's VIR HEROICUS SUBLIMIS.
I was pulled to it as if by a magnet, drawn up close to the life-sized red
canvas, the red consuming my entire field of vision, and I felt shivers running
down my spine. Staring straight ahead, I felt transported to another realm, and
what ran through me for a full minute was a whole world of sensory saturation.
The canvas encased all passion, all desire, all rage, all triumph, and it was
surging excitement, jubilation: the sublime. What I felt was nothing less than
the chaos of the universe, human folly, birth and death, our meaningless
motions, coming together in a form so simple. It is an overflowing power even
though the painting does not laboriously enumerate all human mistakes under the
sky, it does not have any semblance of a character or story, it doesn't have any
material substance other than color and size, for this impalpability mirrors
what we have in the end: nothing. And this sensory experience is the meaning of
the work, needing no other indication than the title: Man Heroic Sublime. Some
attempt to approach the painting using traditional methods, examining its
construction and the artist's background. To do so is to have missed the point.
They place undue emphasis on the vertical lines, the zips, and deconstruct the
order in which Newman painted them—it's a rather simple exercise of withholding
some vertical space with tape and then either painting between a pair or
painting around one. But this is not the right way to look at the painting, and
we do not understand the painting through its technicalities any more than we
get closer to understanding what enables life by analyzing the brain's atomic
makeup. The zips merely serve to provide a sense of size for a painting that
stands taller than any viewer.

I am not suggesting that expression and meaning is limited to abstraction's
dominion. Consider Norman Rockwell's undeniably political THE PROBLEM WE ALL
LIVE WITH, or Caspar David Friedrich's proud WANDERER ABOVE THE SEA OF FOG, or
Giorgio de Chirico's dreary THE MELANCHOLY OF DEPARTURE, or the contrast of
human transience and the mountain's unfazed apathy in Hokusai's EJIRI IN THE
SURUGA. Let's not forget Yayoi Kusama's more visceral infinity mirror
installations that manifest her internal world, rife with obsessions, a black
room illuminated by floating lights all around, all receding into the horizon, a
world on fire from which there is no escape, a world into which the public
voluntarily steps. Or the same concept rendered more explicit in Edvard Munch's
THE SCREAM, which unlike the former cannot be misinterpreted as just a pretty
picture. What I am saying is abstraction's poignance arises from its simplicity
that is too often overlooked, a simplicity that not only enhances a painting's
lyric capacity but elevates the art by inflecting upon its very medium so that
the artist, the process, the art meld into one. Why should a Ronnie Landfield
stare at us less directly and speak to us from further away than Vermeer's GIRL
WITH A PEARL EARRING? In one brush stroke dashing across the surface, one color
reaching upwards, dancing among many in our human dynamism, we see not a
landscape or a portrait but a visual ode singing the tune of our inner
complexity.

To stay clear of art's mystique, I must mention the regrettable reality is that
any mention of art is preceded by its reputation. In this sense, art is like
wine tasting. Wine tasting and, even more importantly, the acquired diction
developed to describe it unfortunately connote class aspiration, class
maintenance, and the whole system of media that reinforce wine's continued
esteem and consumption. We don't dwell a second on wine's unfermented cousin,
the unremarkable grape juice, but we go to considerable lengths to distinguish
between wines by variety, region, year, and color. Though we may sensibly
separate a heavy malbec from a mild pinot noir, when we start throwing around
phrases like "flavor of blackberry", "notes of earthy vanilla", "hints of
seasoned red plum", and "a rich dark chocolate lingering in the aftertaste",
all the while affecting a poker face as we swirl and sniff ourselves into high
oblivion, should we not ask ourselves if there might not be a more productive
use of time than making an impression? Any genuine appreciation for wine is
quickly extinguished when artifice enters the conversation. So too is art when
we chase the big name, attach a price tag, and enshroud it in undue mystery.
The art market has not escaped the American variety of ruthless capitalism, and
decades of rising economic inequality has permitted the rise of rogue
billionaires who patronize rogue artists like Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons. Why
do some artists fetch handsome sums at Christie's or Sotheby's while many of
their peers struggle, forced to sell their work on the street? There is a
market whose taste is determined by an exclusive community, and the clients,
keen on entertaining guests of similar standing, viewing a painting as an
investment, patting themselves on the back for procuring a rarefied treasure
for the spouse, transact in prestige which, too, can be bought. The truth is
that the CEOs, the hedge fund managers, and those in the professional class
whose wealth has passed the threshold where capital allocation alone suffices
for comfortable living have not, over the course of their upward career
trajectory, had the time to calibrate artistic taste. The real artist,
dedicated to his craft as a parent to a child, for whom art is a means of
living, is at the mercy of the tastemakers, the curators, the established
critics. Such is the art market. But American capitalism, ever eager to place
its hand on every exchange, bends the market to its own morality. This is not
art for art's sake but raw capitalism. Let us appreciate art on its own accord,
art for all. As Jerry Saltz says, anyone can look at art—including abstract
art.

<h4>2019-09-29, 日.</h4>
There is a pond outside, wavelings rippling across the surface, a soft, gentle,
constant wind billowing over its still mass. Two adolescent geese are floating
near the edge, wings folded, necks tall and curved like cranes, feathered
chests thrust out like a hen sitting on her eggs, enticing to the hands like a
pomeranian's coat. It is a cloudy afternoon, a uniform grey pall, bleak and
gloom looming in the skies above, time seemingly halted, the movements of the
guiding lights in abeyance, left without an announcement when late afternoon
becomes early evening. Perhaps it is the changing of the seasons. A mild chill
this morning, headwind of the winter ahead.
