NOTE TO SELF:
This file serves as an archive of index.md, and its sections fall into one of
these case:
  1) Old posts I've removed in their entirely and moved them here for my records
  2) Snippets I've deleted from posts still live in index.md
  3) Original posts I've edited so extensively that simply moving some snippets
  here did not make sense, as I removed paragraphs and also changed the text of
  the sections I kept
In addition to these three, because this archive was originally created as a
direct duplication of the index.md at a certain point in time, some of the
older sections here are exact copies of what remain in index.md.

In the second case above, the paragraphs within some snippets here should not be
read as contiguous blocks of text, as I may have moved snippets that were
originally interspersed in the original. Further complicating matters, I have
also put back into index.md some passages or quotes that I initially moved
here, since the re-inserted text remained informative in another part of
index.md.

This file should not be interpreted as a comprehensive archive whose sections
can simply be re-inserted into the original to recreate my original writing. In
fact, this file should be seen as a lax record, as I have also edited much of
index.md without relocating the original passages here. This file is maintained
to keep the significant parts of my older writings in one place. For the actual
snapshots of the originals, refer to the version history in GitHub, but in that
case, there are many versions to search through.

<h4>SNIPPETS FROM: 2024-08-07, 三. On the Political Divide, the Migrant Crisis,
Immigration, Meritocracy, Liberal Hypocrisy, Inequality, Social Capitalism,
Man's Inner World, and Wandering.</h4>

<span id="part-of-intro"></span>
  I want to start by bounding this levity, for it is not the usual escapist sort
  of humor but rather the kind of levity couched in sobriety, not by a turning
  away from reality for a momentary respite but in the incisive, deep humor
  rooted in the unpleasantness of reality, a humor derived from embracing and
  accepting that reality, a humor not in spite of truth but through it and
  thoroughly embedded in it. As Ricky Gervais said at the Oxford Union:
  <blockquote>
  I've just always got up in the morning and wanted to fill the day with as much
  fun as possible. I suppose everything I've done is slightly existential as
  well. From THE OFFICE, it's about, you know, people becoming forty, and are
  they doing the right thing? DEREK—it was about people at the end of their
  life—what can they pass on? Even my children's book, FLANIMALS, was about the
  sort of the futility of life and nature and ironic deaths. And I don't know why
  that is, really. I think it's funny, life. It's amusing because we take
  everything so seriously. We care about everything passionately; we have fights,
  wars, worry about little things, and then we die. And there's nothing. It was
  pointless—pointless—we return to the stars. So I've always thought I want to
  fill my days with fun.
  </blockquote>
  Gervais' quote reminds me of something I wish to mention from one of my two
  favorite novels, Hermann Hesse's THE GLASS BEAD GAME, in Richard and Clara
  Winston's 1969 translation, for which Theodore Ziolkowski wrote a foreword that
  concludes with:
  <blockquote>
  Perhaps even the worst translation could not conceal the "message" of Hesse's
  novel. But only a subtle, sensitive one can render what Thomas Mann called "the
  parody of biography and the grave scholarly attitute." It is easy, too easy, to
  be sober and grave . . . This new translation of <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>
  offers the American reader the opportunity, as Thomas Mann suggested, to dare
  to laugh. If parody alone can adequately render the reality of our times, only
  irony offers us the freedom and detachment that are the essential condition of
  responsible analysis and action.
  </blockquote>
  It is in the context of this kind of humor that the novel should be understood,
  its expansive serious prose expressing the high ideals of the mind and the
  outcome of the protagonist, having labored to climb to the top of the leading
  intellectual academy and to then defect from it, only to go for a casual,
  off-hand swim in a lake but suddenly drowns, too fragile for the real world.
  The novel presents a sense of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, for Ziolkowski
  accurately summarizes Hesse's message, that though Hesse's initial intention
  was to present the idyllic life of the ivory tower, as "the novel was
  originally envisaged as yet another variation in Hesse's continuing search for
  a spiritual dimension of life . . . set apart to pursue its goals in splendid
  isolation, unsullied by the 'reality' that Hesse had grown to distrust", Hesse
  later adopted the grounding tone of returning to the earth, to society, to the
  problems and troubles of reality, because "Hesse advocated thoughtful
  commitment over self-indulgent solipsism, responsible action over mindless
  revolt." For Hesse, "a life consecrated exclusively to the mind is not only
  unfruitful, but also dangerous" in the shift in his belief from "elitism to a
  more compassionate social consciousness". However, it is this suggestion that I
  wish to emphasize: "to dare to laugh", because while it is too easy to not care
  at all, it is also too easy to be serious. Case in point: the earlier
  translation, by Mervyn Savill, comes with a foreword by an Eric Peters who
  rather clearly missed Hesse's message, lingering solely and shortsightedly on
  Hesse's lifelong theme that clarity and nobility can be obtained only through
  the cost of pain, reaching truth only through trial by fire. Peters notes that
  for Hesse, "a state of grace can be obtained only by plunging through the
  torrent of sensuality and emotional unrestraint, not by attempting to skirt or
  by-pass it. Asceticism . . . will always be an evasion: will never lead to
  spiritual calm, to the greater understanding", because "truth . . . must be
  sought the hard way, through experience and suffering." Peters describes
  another of Hesse's novels, STEPPENWOLF: "Here Hesse identifies himself with
  one, Harry Haller, the 'Wolf of the Steppes,' who rebels against the safe, dull
  existence of the bourgeois citizen", citing this passage from the book:
  <blockquote>
  Who to-day wishes to live and have joy of his life must not be like you or I.
  For he who demands music instead instead of tootling, enjoyment instead of
  pleasure, a soul instead of gold, real work instead of activity, true passion
  instead of dalliance, this pretty world is no homeland.
  </blockquote>
  Yes, the book was an example of that way of life, and this impression is the
  often misunderstood reading; the other reading may be less obvious, but the
  words, which may be overlooked at first, are there and perhaps will be more
  apparent to matured eyes, and they hint at the advice that the story is, if not
  a proof, then an example by contradiction, a kind of living that Hesse warned
  against. Hesse himself adds a caution in the introductory author's note in
  STEPPENWOLF, written thirty-four years after the book's publication and one
  year before his death, about readers who:
  <blockquote>
  strangely enough perceived only half of what I intended. These readers, it seems
  to me, have recognized themselves in the Steppenwolf, identified themselves
  within him, suffered his griefs, and dreamed his dreams; but they have
  overlooked the fact that this book knows of and speaks about other things . . .
  I would be happy if many of them were to realize that the story of the
  Steppenwolf pictures a disease and crisis—but not one leading to death and
  destruction, on the contrary: to healing.
  </blockquote>
  Hesse explains a reason for misunderstanding: "Partly, but only partly, this may
  occur so frequently by reason of the fact that this book, written when I was
  fifty years old and dealing, as it does, with the problems of that age, often
  fell into the hands of very young readers." So much for seriousness. And with
  his last book, THE GLASS BEAD GAME, Hesse took a further step, suffusing the
  genuine struggle through trial by fire with a subtle humor: laugh; indeed, dare
  to laugh. Reality, as with many other heavy subjects, often changes flavor and
  becomes more palatable through the inflection of humor, with the semblance of
  carefree distance, looking back on our present circumstances, even though that
  semblance is only a momentary illusion. Today's post is long, and it is one
  that references old writers who wrote a fair bit more lengthily and intensely
  than modern appetites permit, but I invite the reader to preserve a sense of
  humor even in the worst of it. Some of them been gone for generations. But
  there is some truth to the observation that it is often with difficulty and
  discomfort that genuine growth and expansion can occur, so I bid the reader
  retain a sense of humor and find the space to laugh. After all, we're only
  human, and it's just life.

  As for the inspiration for this post, I can only say that my sensibilities were
  granted a visit by a longing which the writer Arthur Machen quite faithfully
  described in the dedication of his 1922 autobiography, FAR OFF THINGS, to his
  editor Alfred Turner:
  <blockquote>
  This is a book, my dear Turner, which I had in my heart to write for many years.
  The thought of it came to me with that other thought that I was growing—rather,
  grown—old; that the curtain had definitely been rung down on all the days of my
  youth. And so I got into the way of looking back, of recalling the far gone
  times and suns of the 'seventies and early 'eighties when the scene of my life
  was being set. I made up my mind that I would write about it all—some day.
  </blockquote>
  The 'seventies and 'eighties Machen was referring to were, of course, those of
  the nineteenth century, of which I, too, recall rather fondly, sharing with
  Machen a sense of wistful passing, an enduring homesickness, surely the pouting
  pines for the times of one's childhood. In case the reader has the slightest
  inkling of a doubt on this claim of mine, I insist that those decades were, for
  me too, the far-gone times when the scene of my own life were endowed an early
  set. The question the reader may be asking is this: whether I am a vampire
  blessed with eternal life. We shall see, my dear reader, we shall see, for the
  reader is not the only one who ponders that question.

  This piece is best read chronologically, but the writer realizes regrettably
  that it has grown rather lengthy and cumbersome. The writer initially intended
  and still, on completion, intends for this piece to be read from beginning to
  end, as the topics build upon one another, and it is with doleful resignation,
  out of this piece's unwieldy stretch, that the writer provides a listing of the
  major sections, whose very structure presumes their clear separability, which
  is dubious. This piece is, the writer concedes, long and heavy, and the reader
  should not expect to finish it in one sitting. Thus, for guidance, is an
  itinerary for our adventure, but we are duly reminded that true adventure is
  treacherous and unmarked, and the fearless traveler needs no itinerary. Hermann
  Keyserling elaborates his thoughts on the matter in THE TRAVEL DIARY OF A
  PHILOSOPHER:
  <blockquote>
  Why should I still go travelling? . . . I want to let the climate of the
  tropics, the Indian mode of consciousness, the Chinese code of life and many
  other factors, which I cannot envisage in advance, work their spell upon me one
  after the other, and then watch what will become of me . . . [W]hen all other
  means fail me, I employ a mechanical device: I take the train and leave my
  world until I have become so estranged from it that I can envisage it as a
  whole and regain my mastery of it . . . In truth, who am I? The older problems
  come up again; only this time they appear less clear than usual, just as if the
  vibrations of the mind were softened by the waves of the sea.
  </blockquote>
  Without further circumnavigating circuition concealing circumlocution, we shall
  gracefully pass over the following random words whose informative shape is an
  arrow pointing downwards. Out of the corner of our eyes, we see in the
  bothersome yonder a trail map no one suffers the trouble to stop and look at:



<u id="immigration">Immigration</u><br>

  My reader, we are serious folks here!
  <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/nancy.maclean">Nancy MacLean</a>
  writes in BEHIND THE MASK OF CHIVALRY: THE MAKING OF THE SECOND KU KLUX KLAN
  about the second Klan in the wake of the surge of immigration in the early
  1900s, focusing on the Athens, Georgia chapter of the Klan, near the birthplace
  of its second incarnation. Although the well-known 1915 movie, D.W. Griffith's
  BIRTH OF A NATION, depicts the KKK primarily as a white supremacy group, in
  reality they also crusaded against Jews and Catholics. MacLean describes how
  the Klan exploited economic fears and put the blame on religious and ethnic
  others:
  <blockquote>
  Local Klan lecturers on "Americanism," for their part, blamed Jews and Catholics
  for the chain-store peril . . . If present trends continued, Imperial Wizard
  [William Joseph] Simmons warned, immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe
  and their children would soon crowd native-born whites out of "the business
  class." Such charges struck a chord with local members, several of whom
  operated in competition with Jews and immigrants from Italy and Greece . . .
  The campaign against chain stores illustrates how impossible it is to
  understand the Klan if one conceives of it as a simple conservative force. The
  Klan was indeed conservative, fiercely so, as the anti-Semitism and nativism of
  the chain-store struggle make clear. Yet the order's politics were different
  from those of the usual standard-bearers of conservatism . . . The Klan put
  forward a populist critique of American society suited to the middling men who
  made up the core of its following. They resented, sometimes vociferously, "the
  silk hat crowd" and the social transformation their reign had wrought . . .
  While it gave voice to middle-class fears of economic concentration and
  political empowerment, it also put up ferocious opposition to social
  reconstruction from the left. In this dualism lay the appeal of the Klan's
  class politics to the lower-middle-class men who flocked to the order in such
  numbers. It articulated the animosity petit-bourgeois whites felt toward
  <i>both</i> capital and labor—and it spoke in idioms at the core of American
  culture.
  </blockquote>
  MacLean concludes that the composite partly of classical liberalism,
  republicanism, and evangelical Protestantism "is best described as reactionary
  populism." It is the second Klan that MacLean is discussing, which was active
  during the early 1900s when immigration was a major issue. MacLean writes:
  <blockquote>
  Simmons believed that "real Americans" simply could not survive factory
  discipline or urban life; farm life was an essential component of American
  manhood . . . Such open hostility toward workers was rare, however; more
  commonly it was packaged as racism. Klansmen blamed virtually all labor trouble
  on immigrants and "foreign agitators"—those its publications depicted as "the
  riff-raff and outcasts of Europe." Simmons maintained that already, in the
  cities of the North and East, ethnic lines had become class lines. The urban
  working class was split between skilled tradesmen from Britain, Germany, and
  Scandinavia, whom he respected as the modern heirs of artisans, and unskilled
  workers from Southern and Eastern Europe, whom he detested. The new immigrants
  lacked the capacity to appreciate republican institutions.
  </blockquote>
  The KKK's visual symbols of the robe and mask, of a group rallied around a
  burning cross in the night, are images of dread and power operating under the
  guise of secrecy. Yet I want to touch on this issue because I believe knowledge
  is power, negligence to history leaves us susceptible to where it may repeat
  itself, and what becomes visible no longer holds the foreboding potency of the
  dark, shrouded in mystery and the unknown. MacLean describes the people who
  joined the Klan:
  <blockquote>
  The portrait that emerges from Klan membership rosters at mid-decade indicates
  that the vast majority of men in the Athens Klan stood between capital and
  unskilled labor. In their occupations, as their assets, local Klansmen hovered
  at the midpoint of the spectrum. The greatest proportions clustered in the
  three categories of lower white-collar employees; petty proprietors, managers,
  and officials; and unskilled tradesmen. Klansmen's patterns of affiliation also
  indicated their relative status: middle-class, not "society." . . . To explain
  the order's appeal, however, the profile of Klan members needs refinement. The
  typical Klansman was not simply petit-bourgeois; he appeared less economically
  secure than the norm for his class. When the proprietor, he was often a
  newcomer, and the value of his holdings was less than the average among owners
  at large . . . They were especially anxious to distinguish
  themselves—particularly through their moral codes—from the ordinary workers
  they viewed as beneath them . . . In short, while the typical Klansmen was
  better off than the vast majority of blacks and a large proportion of whites,
  he was vulnerable. His standing was unstable, and he knew it . . . Many
  national Klan leaders, Simmons and Evans [early leaders of the second Klan]
  included, were themselves "self-made men" and self-consciously so. They had
  risen from much effort from humble beginnings . . . and they sympathized with
  other humble men on the make. The organization clearly aimed at upward-striving
  men, moreover.
  </blockquote>
  I wish to add a point of emphasis that country's history of racial and religious
  intolerance should not be eagerly exaggerated into a backlash, especially by
  contemporary progressives, who too easily commit the same lapse of judgment
  found in historical intolerances, which is to broadly generalize. Reality
  consists of many factors and may in fact be more complex than our minds can
  readily handle. The economic insecurity, class precarity, and personal
  interests of a certain group in a moment in time, morphed by populists into
  racial and religious intolerance and turned into a criminal organization,
  should not be extended to others who superficially bear demographic
  similarities to that group. I do not doubt racial and religious intolerances
  remain in the country, but any facile anti-white argument citing the Klan as an
  example is untenable when the fact of the matter is that it was also a
  predominantly white country that pressured Klan members to remain anonymous and
  which also led to its decline. Any such argument will also have to contend with
  the fact of the Civil War. If we position the Klan within Turchin's framework
  of counter-elites mobilizing the masses—certainly the petit-bourgeois, afraid
  of losing their status, were not immiserated masses, but that difference may be
  only one of degree, as the Klan was only a marginal, not a predominant,
  group—then we have what may be a more holistic view: that such a phenomenon
  recurs over history, among any group. By extension, I wish to suggest a
  consequence of this fact: just as everyone has the capacity to do good, so too
  does everyone has sinister potential, and it is the circumstances which funnel
  people into actions sensible to them.

  It is perhaps a cliché disclaimer I am adding, but it is important to prioritize
  individuals and reality, which is more often than not multifaceted and complex,
  that is it sometimes not easy to piece together data points, that each episode
  and narrative has not one but multiple sides and perspectives, to not make
  blanket statements about whole groups of people. For instance,
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lw-z-p8AAAAJ&hl=en">Alexandra Horowitz</a>
  wrote a book called ON LOOKING: ELEVEN WALKS WITH EXPERT EYES, describing, on
  walks in the same neighborhood, how experts in different fields notice very
  different things, and from each of their vantages, even an identical space
  doesn't quite look the same. Perhaps it's true that a significant component in
  how a person turns out is the person's environment which enables certain
  pursuits and interests, enforces some of them over time, discourages others,
  brings exposure to certain kinds of people, are materially wealthy or deprived,
  all of which weigh on the individual's life trajectory which could very have
  turned out quite different under other scenarios. I think it's true, as
  Nietzsche proposed, that there are no inherently good or evil people, but only
  shades of nuance, that every person possesses both good and evil impulses and
  tendencies, but some combination of the individual and the environment
  ultimately resolve in the outcome of the person. It may be that the person's
  environment informs many opportunities or privations which enable more good
  than evil, or the other way around. One maxim from La Rochefoucauld, who
  meditated on the man's deceptions to others and also to himself, can perhaps
  be applied through a hopeful angle: "Circumstances reveal our virtues and our
  vices, like light reveals objects."

  Another Senate
  <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/hearings/fairness-and-fiscal-responsibility-cracking-down-on-wealthy-tax-cheats">hearing</a>
  last year, also with a politically charged title, was called FAIRNESS AND FISCAL
  RESPONSIBILITY: CRACKING DOWN ON WEALTHY TAX CHEATS. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse
  describes (at 0:53:05) a visual illustration of how complicated a corporate
  entity can be structured to avoid taxes. Senator Mitt Romney attempts
  (1:08:03) to justify such complexity, saying that sometimes businesses are by
  nature that complicated, not out of design to evade taxes, but he also
  acknowledges that corporations do try to minimize taxes, with the qualifier
  that they do so within the bounds of the law. However,
  <a href="https://www.cato.org/people/chris-edwards">Chris Edwards</a>
  from Cato, making a gesture of honesty, acknowledges (1:19:00) from his
  experience that, "A lot of what drives that chart, frankly, is corporations
  making extremely sophisticated structures to avoid tax. They don't try to do
  things that are illegal. It's just that the tax code is so grey, they push the
  limits." But more importantly!—sure enough, Senator Kennedy recourses
  (1:36:52) to his signature move: calling up someone's old tweet—thy tweet comes
  back for vengeance! It's too bad that this is a senate committee where words
  are held accountable, and Senator Kaine once again stepped in at the very end
  to situate the tweet's in its original circumstance. But we've gotten ahead of
  ourselves! In the heat of the moment, Senator Kennedy was commencing his
  profound investigation! This time, though, he loses some of his charm from
  indulging too long on a combative exchange with his victim,
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ili51ooAAAAJ&hl=en">Natasha Sarin</a>.
  The tweet in question this time: "The House Republican stance is, I kid you not,
  support for Israel as long as we make it easier for people to cheat on their
  taxes." As if personally offended, Senator Kennedy says he found
  Sarin "appalling", positively "appalling", because Sarin "didn't talk to any
  of 'em [House Republicans]." His astute verdict this time—"I'm going to remind
  you: you can only be young once, but you can always be immature." This was a
  very mature comment from the senator, if the writer must say so himself!
  Immediately afterwards, Senator Kennedy found himself needing to stand his
  ground against the rebuff of the committee's chairman, Senator Whitehouse, who
  said, "I think that the treatment of the witnesses is beginning to degrade a
  bit here"; but Senator Kennedy insisted on his insightful analysis of her
  revealing tweet, saying, "I'm entitled to test their credibility, and I think
  one of our witnesses just got tested." A tweet, indeed! One mighty fine test
  there! Quite astonishing!

  . . .

  It may be worth noting that the city comptroller's report makes no attempt at
  suggesting a reduction to the city's debt; rather, the entire report orients
  itself around how much more debt the city can take on until it reaches the
  limit, and, because the report anticipates that debt will continue to rise and
  that the remaining gap to the limit, which is called "debt-incurring power",
  will consequently diminish from $30.5 billion in FY 2023 to $15.9 billion in FY
  2027 (end-of-year numbers), the cit
  <a href="https://cbcny.org/research/setting-right-ceiling">requested</a>,
  according to the Citizens Budget Commission, that the state raise the city's
  debt limit. As stated in the city comptroller's report, according to New York
  State law, the general debt limit for local governments is pegged against the
  jurisdiction's real estate value, so it doesn't seem like the debt limit can be
  arbitrary raised. Governor Kathy Hochul, instead, raised the Transitional
  Finance Authority (TFA) debt limit from $13.5 billion to $25.5 billion—this is
  debt exempt from the general debt limit, and anything above this exemption,
  referred to as "incremental TFA", counts towards the general limit. Due to its
  high debt, the city, of course, had already maxed out the old exemption
  allocation and at the end of FY 2023 had an incremental TFA of $31.9 billion, a
  high enough number that rendered the higher exemption a record-keeping trick—in
  other words, the state's increasing the TFA exemption by $12 billion merely
  adjusted the accounting on debt that already existed, shifting the incremental
  TFA (retroactively in this example of 2023 numbers) down to $19.9 billion and
  the total indebtedness from $96.9 billion down to $84.9 billion. In short, it
  seems that the city is content with only servicing the debt and paying
  interest, not seeking to reduce the principal; the comptroller report confirms
  that its objective is to remain below the "the 15 percent [of tax revenue]
  ceiling used to evaluate affordability as articulated in the City's debt
  management policy." The report even goes further to poke at the definition of
  the state's definition of the debt limit, as though it unduly restricts the
  city's borrowing power: "[B]ecause the debt limit does not take into account
  the City's significantly more diversified tax revenue structure [as opposed to
  other jurisdictions in the state, which rely primary on property taxes], the
  debt limit does not fully reflect the City's ability to assume and service debt
  to finance infrastructure." I am not suggesting that the city's objective is a
  problem, as tax revenue grows alongside debt, or that the city is under an
  unsustainable debt burden, as the comptroller's report reassures us otherwise,
  but I wish to underscore the fact that the city's debt is considerable and will
  continue to grow.

<u id="gender-studies-prima">Gender Studies, <i>prima</i></u><br>

  A very important digression on the matter of the scope and impact of gender
  performance, written by someone who does not wish to be left out of the
  important conversation, because the writer desires to be a gender theorist,
  too!

  We must start with some ground rules, some unyielding laws which apply
  everywhere and to all. The reader responds: How rigid that sounds, how
  mandating and restrictive! Yet it is but one law, short and sweet: the
  principle of equality for everyone.

  Armed with so nefarious and unreasonably restrictive a law, let us now proceed
  with our subject matter. From whom does this discussion arise? Not a you or a
  me but a they! A
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NCOGqg8AAAAJ&hl=en">Judith Butler</a>
  asserts that sex as a biological fact is distinct from gender as a construction,
  and on this view it is contended that gender is performative. Butler herself
  describes the essential dichotomy in a
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD9IOllUR4k">video</a>.
  A most studiously studious student am I, I performed a student and consulted her
  book GENDER TROUBLE, in which she writes:
  <blockquote>
  [A] split is introduced in the feminist subject by the distinction between sex
  and gender . . . [T]he distinction . . . serves the argument that whatever
  biological intractability sex appears to have, gender is culturally
  constructed; hence, gender is neither the causal result of sex nor as seemingly
  fixed as sex . . . [T]here is no reason to assume that genders ought also to
  remain as two . . . When the constructed status of gender is theorized as
  radically independent of sex, gender itself becomes a free-floating artifice,
  with the consequence that <i>man</i> and <i>masculine</i> [as relating to
  gender] might just as easily signify a female body as a male one; and
  <i>woman</i> and <i>feminine</i> a male body as easily as a female one . . . In
  this sense, <i>gender</i> is not a noun, but neither is it a set of
  free-floating attributes . . . [G]ender proves to be performative—that is,
  constituting the identity it is purported to be . . . The challenge for
  rethinking gender categories outside of the metaphysics of substance will have
  to consider the relevance of Nietzsche's claim in <i>On the Genealogy of
  Morals</i> that "there is no 'being' behind doing, effecting, becoming: 'the
  doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed—the deed is everything."

  I, still performing as a student, am convinced ever more to join the gender
  theorists at the table and defend against the "masculine hegemony and
  heterosexist power" which Butler describes thus:
  <blockquote>
  This text continues, then, as an effort to think through the possibility of
  subverting and displacing those naturalized and reified notions of gender that
  support masculine hegemony and heterosexist power, to make gender trouble, not
  through the strategies that figure a utopian beyond, but through the
  mobilization, subversive confusion, and proliferation of precisely those
  constitutive categories that seek to keep gender in its place by posturing as
  the foundational illusions of identity.
  </blockquote>
  Strong words they have written there! My first instinct in searching for the
  purpose of this grand theory is to look anywhere other than as a whole endeavor
  towards a power play, that anyone is doing anything but conjuring all manner of
  ploys to claim power and committing the same heinous crime of hegemony they
  themselves seek to abolish! And then words and words and words and
  post-structural accusation which themselves are subject to the same
  accusations! Yet even if I looked there and admit myself to the strategem, who
  am I to deny the plight of my many-gendered brethren? This, of course, is a
  consequence of agreeing to the principle of equality for all. This humble
  writer insists that he does not stand in the way of gender-performers marching
  onward! How dangerous to obstruct a full frontal charge! But still, I, an
  aspiring gender theorist, pledge myself to the mission of practicing gender
  theory! And of what manner art this idea of gender? Butler writes:
  <blockquote>
  Genders can be neither true nor false, neither real nor apparent, neither
  original nor derived. As credible bearers of those attributes, however, genders
  can also be rendered thorougly and radically <i>incredible</i>.
  </blockquote>
  Before I was blind but now I see! Having consulted the terms of gender, I must
  now introduce zer high-zess of zer person:

  Name: Zanuva<br>
  Pronoun: ze/zer/zeself<br>
  Personality: superhero with unimaginable powers but who utilizes her powers only
  to shape shift, making lots of noise while doing so. Ze has the minor fault of
  being prone to self-display. It may be asked as to why does Zanuva, with all
  her supreme powers, chooses not to solve the world's problems but instead
  preoccupies zerself so extensively with shape shifting. I, a mere mortal who
  doesn't know better, risking myself merely to understand this greatness of
  power, dare not ask, but serve the purpose only of recording the facts of my
  narrow understanding. And let the writer make himself as clear as the blue sky:
  the writer is to ze as a rabbit is to the firmament of the stars behind that
  blue sky: ze's powers are theoretically known to exist but unseen and
  inconceivable to rabbit eyes and rabbit minds.

  To the end of understanding what this exciting "<i>incredible</i>" gender
  entails, I take zer as my guiding light. My finite mind can commence but
  simply: let me start with gender as a spectrum, and my limited understanding
  must ground itself on a numerical interpretation: male-performers are a 1, and
  female-performers are a 2, and everything in between constitutes this spectrum.
  Supposing the law of numbers holds true, 2 > 1, and for the benefit of the
  great feminists I thus quiet any protest from the fairer gender at the outset.
  Having defined this spectrum, though—ze almighty feels constrained already. In
  fact, so mighty are ze's superpowers that ze puts everyone else to shame: ze
  can perform multiple genders at the same time. Nor does ze limit zeself to only
  three genders; the more the merrier under the auspices of ze's whims; on some
  days, ze halves her performances; on others, she tops up by a double and a
  half. From behind our awe-struck lenses, we commoners see that it is possible
  not only that ze can juggle ten tennis balls by holding all ten at the same
  time, but that under the pressure of so divine a power, not even the
  traditional male and female performances can confine zer: ze has, against all
  odds of physical limitation, gender hormones be damned—though why are we
  commoners surprised at all? We commoners are bound by such vulgarities as
  physical laws but we are speaking of the unstoppable ze!—liberated zeself from
  the flat confines between a 1 and a 2. At this precise moment in this year of
  2024, we pause reality for just a moment to consider ze's performances: this is
  a rare instance when ze is performing only four genders! On paper, we hasten to
  capture this shape-shifting hyperspectrum as: G[5, 7.3, 3, 9.5]. My tiny
  imagination limits my numerical scope, but I hear numbers can rise infinitely.
  My small curiosity wonders: why can't they go in the other direction too?

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  His excellency's size being as great as I have said, all our sculptors and all
  our painters will agree without protest that his belt would have been 50,000
  feet around, which gives him very good proportions. His nose taking up one
  third of his attractive face, and his attractive face taking up one seventh of
  his attractive body, it must be admitted that the nose of the Sirian is 6,333
  feet plus a fraction; which is manifest.

  <br>

  Yet for brevity which by no means intends any disrepect, ignorance, or
  misrepresentation, but solely for the sake of the convenience of conversation,
  as many long titles have come to be known through abbreviation, we can average
  the gender scores into one number and note by parenthesis how many performances
  are hidden behind this deceptively simple singleton. So ze's gender, without
  loss of representation, can be shortened to: G6.2 (4). As a side note, it may
  be of interest to the reader that the writer himself identifies as G0.63
  (1.2) and has done so for many years. As a disciple of ze, the writer admits to
  having gleaned something of a glance into the engima of gender potentialities.
  And what could this mean, this quantity of 1.2 performances? The writer does
  not know himself and is merely dabbling in what he can, his hands and mind
  daily trembling at the might of the almighty. For the whole while in which he
  has dedicated himself to studying the rarefied gender compositions, laboring
  over the impossible formulations, attacking the scriptures from every angle,
  the writer still has not been convinced he can come to bear on any firm
  comprehension of gender performing. Where mortals such as the writer are
  concerned, such things are beyond understanding, but the writer is sure such
  mysteries pose no difficulty to zer. To mortals, however, ze would respond: the
  addition of a 0.2 is not inherent in the idea of a performance to the extent
  that if one were handed a script for a role, one is given a whole script and
  not a fifth, but the fact itself of the surplus 0.2 creates just that much more
  of a role: the 0.2 justifies itself by being a 0.2. Of the intrinsic qualities
  of this 0.2, again, we mortals cannot know of, but by this process of
  self-creation we ought to be satisfied within the confines of our earthly
  conceptions. Every gender, after all, is only a social construction. And if
  such attributes of ourselves as gender in our relation to society are all
  constructions, why should the ferociously potent (maybe even omnipotent) ze
  stop zer construction at gender? Ze's whimsy extends as well to age: childhood,
  adulthood, old age, are for the same reason social constructions. Why should a
  retiree perform any differently than an airline pilot cruising through a
  blizzard? Why should a middle-aged careerist male-performer undertake any
  responsibilities beyond those given to female-performing toddler playing with
  her barbies? Age-performing is, ze proudly proclaims, rather separate from
  biological age. As a matter of fact, ze is of multiple religious persuasions;
  ze is a Jain, a Protestant, Muslim and Jewish all in one, and in whichever
  religious establishment she enters, temple or church or mosque or synagogue or
  the soil of the earth, she walks on all of their grounds as faithful a servant
  to the holy holiness as any of her fellow observers bound by only a single
  religion. Why, ze insists, should anyone be blessed by one faith if one can be
  blessed by all?

  At this point, I am confused at the apparent contradictions: how can one follow
  multiple deities who each claim they are the only one? I, confused beyond all
  imagination in the midst of this predicament, must refer to a clarifying
  source. The all-knowing city of New York has prescribed us commoners a
  <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hra/downloads/pdf/services/lgbtqi/Gender%20Pronouns%20final%20draft%2010.23.17.pdf">document</a>
  proclaiming: "You can't always know what someone's gender pronoun is by looking
  at them." My, my, how the plot thickens. How shall a perpetual man-performer
  brave such a treacherous new world in which all his prior knowledge no longer
  stands, his very reality pulled out from all around him? He is in no doubt an
  LGBTQI ally, a TGNC ally, a two-spirit ally (the writer himself being a free
  spirit who, nevertheless, can count his spirits with one finger), but in
  defending his peers for equality, who comes to defend his? Seeing no one
  rushing to his rescue, he understands it must be himself! And the only place
  that consoles him, that offers him peace, that reaffirms who he is in his
  otherwise pitiable situation in which he was born male and chooses to perform
  male, is the last bastion of his dignity: the Men's Room.

  Suppose we are confronted with an occasion where ze performs as G1.264 (52) when
  ze wishes to avail zeself to some rest, ze decides to bless the ground of the
  Men's Room with zer grace. Yet when ze comes marching into the Men's Room, does
  ze perform some of ze's superpowers by coming to use a urinal currently
  occupied by another male-performer? Under our premise of equality, if any old
  male-performer doesn't get to enjoy the privilege of walking up behind another
  and start using the same urinal simultaneously, neither does ze. Why should ze
  receive such a privilege another male-performer does not? No—ze, like every
  male-performer, should procur ze's own urinal, preferably also observing the
  unspoken code among male-performers to leave the gap of an empty urinal in
  between gentle-male-performers. Should ze fancy taking on a new gender,
  becoming G1.7 (13), while ze is in the midst of doing ze's business, the sound
  of the stream still audible, we must take it to mean, on the assumption that
  ze's performing ze's gender is completely within ze's control, that ze ought to
  restrain zer new performing until ze finishes relieving zer stream, washes zer
  hands which strangely do not themselves perform gender, and helps zeself out of
  the premises of the Men's Room where generally only male-performers are allowed
  in this equal country. Note that I used the example of 1.7, which fits into our
  commoners' bounds between 1 and 2, and, rounding to the nearest digit, becomes
  a 2, which in our mortal human terminology means female. How can a female
  suddenly emerge in the gender-performing space of the male? And what of the
  many other possiblities ze almost always indulges in which lay beyond
  heteronormative binary?  I must now generalize: as I observed earlier, ze's
  urges are by no means confined to a dull 1 or a dry 2. Ze goes anywhere ze
  wishes, at any time ze demands, shifts to the wind as a blade of grass in the
  midst of a tornado, molds zeself faster than a woman-performer demands to buy
  more clothes. We commoners are further humbled then, forced by the necessity of
  defining a conversion method in order that we may accommodate ze and ze's
  heavenly inspirations, forced, out of lack of options and in guilty
  embarrassment, to bring ze's gender down to our dirty earth: as it stands, many
  of our restrooms come in only two flavors. Pondering the methods of this
  transference, we gaze up at zer, zer nature impetuous, zer style imperious, zer
  waves of hand invulnerable, zer gender indefinable: it is then that we realize
  that we mortals have no hope of coming up with any scheme that can satisfy ze
  and must leave the means of transference to zeself. In our surrender, we say:
  ze, thy swings of mood impossible to comprehend, thou wilt chooseth thy mode of
  rest when thy cometh unto our rooms! How, for us comprehendeth the complicated
  manner of mappeth un fickle 7.2 to our mortal prisoneth of male and female? To
  much of ze's disappointment, by the adamance of mathematical rounding, ze
  happens on some days to choose the Men's Room. But having discerned zer room of
  rest, ze, walking into the room, must abide by the rules of conduct in said
  room and perform accordingly to the gender of zer selection. Why must this be
  so, ze asks? Ze feels restrained from expressing zer freedom, feels imprisoned
  by the male-performers' multiple and unyielding codes of conduct—ze's feelings
  are not adequately conveyed by so small a word as "uncomfortable", for ze feels
  entirely handcuffed, fettered, pilloried, shackled, suffocating. How can ze
  rest in what amounts to a wretched prison? Against so calumnious a charge, we
  humble earthly souls, having no other means of reasoning, can turn only to our
  one base principle: we respond by observing that the law of equality applies
  everywhere and to everyone in the space-gender continuum. In this cosmic
  uncertainty, immeasurably vast is this domain, amorphous is its structure,
  indecipherable are the laws, where every being is indiscernible, a real no
  man's land, we, with the benefit of many generations of scrupulous observations
  and painstakingly recorded data, have discovered some astonishing revelations:
  space may change, gender may change—but from the vantage from any point within
  space-gender, equality applies equally to all. As male-performers declared
  their role at the door, so too must ze; as male-performers follow through with
  their performing duty, so too must ze. Until the day when all public restrooms
  no longer bisect the population into two types of performance, until the day
  when restrooms might as well remove their gender description and may be known
  as the all-inclusive "Restroom", until the day when humans stop dividing among
  themselves, well, when we step into the law-binding space of the Men's Room,
  everyone bound by the equality of space-gender must perform male. Outside the
  room, we may all perform as we so desire, but in the Room known as the Men's,
  the law of equality stiffens our bodies, restrains our mental impulses,
  rigidifies our mortal aspirations, controls our whims so that no, we cannot
  within the confines bounded by the walls of the Men's Room choose to perform
  any number of genders whose net effect amounts to any other gender than that
  declared at the door.

  My words mean zer no harm. I am doing nothing but advocating what gender
  theorists, the writer himself aspiring to become one, promote: equality for
  all, no matter how one performs. Under the premise of equality, biological
  males who perform the male gender receive no privileges by announcing what
  gender they are performing today, so why should ze? Ze doth protesteth: "I must
  pay my bills, hold a job, respect others, operate within a social and economic
  and political system?" The answer, it cannot be denied, based on our premise of
  equality, is: "Yes, just like everyone else."

  —Rousseau, DISCOURSE ON THE ORIGIN OF INEQUALITY
  </span>

  <br>

  Speaking plainly, let us, for illustrative purposes, follow gender theory's
  argument to its end. Let us suppose the premises of gender theory were given
  societal predominance, and everyone in the country can freely perform any
  gender; not only that, but the whole spectrum of social equality has become
  part and parcel of the very fabric of the country. The purported equality has
  been gained to such an extent that it is an integrated component of daily life,
  so comprehensive and unquestioned, so habituated and accepted, that it no
  longer needs to be brought to conscious awareness: people can express their
  gender, their personality, their whims, as pervasively as mammals breathe air
  and humans walk on two legs; people of all genders and every demographic group
  are treated equally and given the same opportunities in school admissions,
  hiring, promotions; social dynamics are free of discrimination predicated on
  implicit or explicit prejudice of gender, sex, race, ethnicity, age,
  religion—yet for all this, the fact remains that inequality continues:
  differential talents, abilities, class of origin, ambition, knowledge base,
  appetite for risk, luck, knowing the right people. From natural inequality
  arises unequal performances and differing material realities. Economic
  inequality, as a component of capitalism, persists. Here, we must remind
  ourselves that the free market is the lesser evil relative to communism's false
  and unsustainable equality. And as social equality in this hypothetical, utopic
  country is both the law of the land and the practice in social relations, so it
  must it be admitted that every gender, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, age, is
  equally liable to economic inequality—under social equality, the courses of
  economic inequality applies equally to all. In other words, the same
  foundational inequality before gender theory prevailed in the country remains,
  just with the personnel shuffled. It is in this sense that total equality
  cannot be attained, as some inequality necessarily remains as an outgrowth of
  natural inequality and self-interest. I don't think it's feasible to completely
  abolish inequality. What we can do, it seems to me, is to constrain the extent
  of inequality, continuing to reward fruitful talents and labor in proportion to
  their productivity, but preventing the extreme accumulation of power and
  privilege and the explosive growth of unending greed, which is insatiable. To
  this end, a society of constrained inequality but composed of healthy
  productivity may even seem to some liberals as more prosperous than one which
  speaks of false promises of and mandated equality which in actuality effects
  only airs, words, reactionary emotions fueled by a widespread sense of
  oppression. Where inequality is properly constrained, that inequality may even
  be deemed justified: the more ambitious and capable earn their due rewards. If
  one so insists on performing gender, either due to a more genuine
  identification or out of spite to masculine or cultural hegemony, I am not one
  to oppose anyone, but please do keep in mind the old adage and don't place all
  of one's eggs in one basket and hope that gender theory can solve all the
  inequality in the world.

  I will observe a further point. If the purpose of performing gender is to
  subvert power relations, and this is a liberal mission, originating among the
  urban meritocrats and academics and college campuses, then we can note a
  remarkable similarity to the conservative response in its populist incarnation
  in the Republican party which may be seen as another beckon for power, in the
  retrospective, traditional form. However, these two forces need not be
  interpreted as diametrically opposed, that the sway of one comes at the cost of
  the other, but that despite the surface demographic differences, both calls for
  power are situated on top of the real, underlying source of power inequality.
  We can liken both the liberal and the conservative to two treadmills at the
  back of a pickup truck: no matter how furiously either side cycles, it is not
  the cycling that causes the appearance of movement, but the truck driver, and
  the truck driver is the money at the top: financial moguls, CEOs, tech
  wunderkinds, those who have taken free reign in the past few decades by
  accumulating power, hoarding the fruits of productivity gains for themselves
  instead sharing them with their workers, pressuring for lax taxation, creating
  a general state of affairs in which massive wealth inequality is the rule for
  the whole country. I will expand on this idea when I discuss social
  capitalism.

  Returning to the issue of gender: although I am not expert on the matter, let us
  briefly consider what gender is, in its various components:

  1) biological sex<br>
  2) gender as performance<br>
  3) whether performed gender should affect biological sex (medical transition, hormone therapy)<br>
  4) sexual orientation

  I consider only the first two points, and only at an initial level. The last two
  are their own topics, quite beyond the scope of this discussion; the writer
  himself admits that he did not know gender was this complicated. However, in my
  view, the notion of gender as performance and a social construction (the second
  point) is quite separate from whether the performativity necessarily
  encompasses physical change (the third point), and it is a question whether
  physical gender transition should be considered part of gender performance as a
  social construct or a related and more general and process. Again, the writer
  maintains that he passes no moral judgment; nor is he suggesting any inhibition
  on anyone's freedom. He is merely considering the facts of gender as
  performance.

  On the first point, in addition to the traditional binary of male and female, there
  are those who are born intersex; these are biologically nonbinary individuals.
  <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/contributors/leonard-sax-md-phd">Leonard Sax</a>
  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3813612">suggested</a>
  that the frequency rate of intersex individuals in the population may be as low
  as 0.018%. It is worth emphasizing that these differences themselves are not
  grounds for social inequality, and their scarcity does not imply neglect, but
  only the need for further clarification. The Center for American Progress has
  <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/key-issues-facing-people-intersex-traits/">shared</a>
  information relating to the discrimination towards intersex individuals, and Sax
  writes in his paper, "These individuals are of course entitled to the same
  expert care and consideration that all patients deserve." As for the second
  point, I will give it greater attention when we revisit gender theory later in
  this post, once we establish more context.

  are not represented in the image of the typical college student, calling them
  the "marginalized majority":
  <blockquote>
  Our conceptions of the typical idealized college student are based on
  traditional notions and an imagined norm of someone who begins college
  immediately after high school, enrolls full-time, lives on campus, and is ready
  to begin college-level classes . . . [F]ocusing attention on the traditional

  neglected <i>other half</i> of U.S. higher education . . . For too long, it has
  been assumed that what works for the dominant and more elite groups can work in
  underresourced contexts with differing challenges. This is simply a hypothesis
  that thus far has not been born out in reality. Resource rich school with great
  pools of upper middle class parental capital and assistance function very well
  for those students. The same structure has not been shown to function very well

  But what about those who haven't gone to college? Oliver Anthony's song,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro">RICH MEN NORTH OF RICHMOND</a>
  struck a particular chord with large swaths of the country last summer, and
  based on the song's popularity, it would be lax not to take popular
  immiseration seriously. Arguing between Republican and Democrats is not
  relevant here because this is not so much a race issue or a gender issue as a
  class issue. Politics aside, I would go even further with an observation on
  human nature, as Ayn Rand writes in THE FOUNTAINHEAD:
  <blockquote>
  As a matter of fact, one can feel some respect for people when they suffer. They
  have a certain dignity. But have you ever looked at them when they're enjoying
  themselves? That's when you see the truth. Look at those who spend the money
  they've slaved for—at amusement parks and side shows. Look at those who're rich
  and have the whole world open to them. Observe what they pick out for
  enjoyment. Watch them in the smarter speak-easies. That's your mankind in
  general . . . The people had come to witness a sensational case, to see
  celebrities, to get material for conversation, to be seen, to kill time. They
  would return to unwanted jobs, unloved families, unchosen friends, to drawing
  rooms, evening clothes, cocktail glasses and movies, to unadmitted pain,
  murdered hope, desire left unreached, left hanging silently over a path on
  which no step was taken, to days of effort not to think, not to say, to forget
  and give in and give up. But each of them had known some unforgotten
  moment . . . when each had known a different sense of living. And each
  remembered other moments . . . when each had wondered why there was so much
  suffering and ugliness in the world. They had not tried to find the answer and
  they had gone on living as if no answer were necessary. But each had known a
  moment when, in lonely, naked honesty, he had felt the need of an answer.
  </blockquote>
  Anthony's situation and his struggle deserves sympathy, not scorn or
  condescension. However, I will say that sympathy itself is not enough, and that
  liberals too often indulge in it without taking any remedial action is
  reprehensible, that they will go only so far as sympathy, feelings, and words,
  only to leave the situation as it stands. Moreover, I wish to comment on the
  nature of sympathy itself. To regard those less fortunate and feel contrition,
  guilt, or inhibition is a relation of pity, a horrible form of connection, and
  also a limitation of the self. I am not saying one should not sympathize with
  those with less, but that to confine ourselves to feckless embarrassment is to
  be content with a relation in which we hold the advantage and take no action to
  resolve any ills. We must keep in mind that we should have an eye on both: the
  relation to those with less but also the arrow forward and upward, that it is
  just as important to sympathize with the humble as it is to aspire higher.
  Nietzsche proposed his ethical ideal of affirmation, progress, vitality in
  one's abilities, to endure the hail and sleet and struggle in order to achieve,
  but he did so as a response to the prevailing religious morality demanding
  compassion for the weak and feeble—Nietzsche's positive affirmation to realize
  the self's potential disposed of the relation to the unfortunate. But I suggest
  that one can do them both, to maintain the arrow down and also the arrow up. To
  compete, to progress, to produce, to innovate, to excel, to push forward
  individually and collectively—it is this positive affirmation which has been
  lost in the current climate of inhibition, contrition and guilt over privilege,
  self-censorship, witch-hunting others for unearned advantages, when I say that
  whatever one's station in life, one must push forward to the best of one's
  abilities given wherever opportunities comes one's way, that rather than
  rampantly complaining and spreading needless toxicity, one make do with what
  one is given and continue forward.

  <br>

  I say we compete and look upon the successes of others as shimmering beacons of
  hope, progress, and exemplars of man's potential, to learn the broad reaches of
  what is possible by earthly, human spirits, to see the accomplishments of
  others and feel mutual admiration, not a compulsion to tear down or expose
  privilege, but as a point of pride and continued inspiration. It is to see the
  triumph of others and ask: what have they done? How can it be better? I say we
  set our sights high, aspire, struggle, endure long nights, scars, sulfur and
  brimstone, move mountains, while at the same keep in mind the humble and
  underserved, to help the greater good not by false modesty or virtue signaling
  or nodding to the contemporary fashionable attitude towards equality for all
  while doing little to match that ideal, but rather to act on that demand, to
  spread wealth and ideas, to inspire and compel, to invigorate and sustain, to
  lift and ever again push forward, to pay fair wages and our dues in taxes and
  share ideas and innovation. I say, towards excellence, innovation, production,
  diligence, growth, progress—to excel, build, consolidate, create, to expand in
  every direction, improve in every dimension. Why limit ourselves to anything
  less than the sky? The artist Barnett Newman created a sculpture called BROKEN
  OBELISK, an obelisk torn in half, severed, and inverted, resting on a
  pyramid—it is an austere piece made of rusted steel, undecorated, severe, yet
  it is us: man is broken, imperfect, finite, lost in the universe, a grain of
  sand washed up on the cosmic shore, yet by the strength of his own will
  uproots, constructs, and lifts himself up above his tools and towards the
  sky—man, the dust of the earth, grounded and mortal, can reach upwards, broken
  but undefeated. It is man holding his hands up against the light, conscious of
  his own limitations, but defying them anyways. It is the naked man unyielding
  to his infirm position against the forest jaguar, lions and hippos and
  alligators, the herds of the Serengeti, the vast, perilous ocean, against
  earthquakes and tsunamis and volcanos, against the dark ages of ignorance,
  against even the hysteria among his own kin. It is the old man reacquainted
  with the excitement of his youth, the original spectacle of his birth. It is
  man who desires to discover, to explore, to risk, to sail the seas, the
  travail, to go beyond. It is man who tirelessly examines himself, his systems,
  his creations, and refines, polishes, enhances. It is man who has taken it upon
  himself to mold nature, to tame it, to identify its faults and improve it. It
  is man who admires the grandeur of the oceans and the skies and the dark spaces
  above, look at his own minute creations, and say in spite of it: I will do what
  I can to better you. It is man who looks up at the night sky and says: what are
  you? It is man who says: there I shall go. It is man who considers his
  inconsequentially small self against the impossibility of his task and says: I
  can, and I will. To every plumber, dentist, painter, researcher, arborist,
  venture capitalist, custodian, programmer, mechanic, landscaper, driver,
  student, curator, surgeon, copywriter, designer, manager, advertiser, engineer,
  freelancer, musician, undertaker, actor, lawyer, barista, entrepreneur,
  consultant, I say: onward and forward. Away with the lip service and
  inhibition, towards substance, action, and execution: towards accountability,
  respect for the self, commitment to the land, duty to others, towards
  individual greed subsumed into the whole, towards the positive affirmation of
  life and striving. A genuinely positive relation to others that can be
  manifested into reality entails generating value, enhancing production,
  spurring the economy, not to feel everywhere burdened by perceived privilege,
  constrained by contemporary malaise, complicit to some cabal, projecting a
  public sympathy to the underserved yet in actuality taking no action to uplift
  any community but one's own interests, or, worse, identifying with
  progressivism and proclaiming equality for all, only to be the main culprit and
  beneficiary of that inequality. I say that the love of our fellow humans, and
  in fact the love of mankind, is served not by regarding others with empty
  sympathy, a horrible positioning of others as lower and ourselves as the
  successful members of society whose consolatory words serve as signals to our
  position of advantage as we reap the benefits of identifying with the
  predominant social mores: nay—I say we give everyone the tools to succeed and
  grow themselves, to endow power and inspiration to all, to do away with
  ineffectual pity and sympathy. I say we should not be so proud of our mutual
  back-patting with compassion and feelings of tenderness and commiseration, with
  the attendant positioning of ourselves as advantaged, but that we should aspire
  to not even need to consider those less fortunate because we have already given
  them the skills, tools, outlook, opportunities to improve their circumstances
  by their own right, and when we do occasion to see them, our relation to them
  is not a shameful pity which prompts a temporary handout that alleviates for
  the day but doesn't solve the problem which returns in the morrow, but a proud
  solidarity that they are bettering themselves, gainfully, responsibly,
  sustainably—they do not need us because they have themselves, free and with
  their own two hands. Such a conception is informed not by an indulgent,
  complacent, devious smile concealing the entitlement of occupying an advantaged
  position, but a smile derived from difficulty and tribulation, to push the self
  to work and produce, to smile not because one is free from labor and struggle
  but to smile through the joy and accomplishment from toil and industry, to look
  at own's work with pride and the sense of contributing to the betterment of the
  self and the whole. If inequality is an inevitable malice in civil society,
  then that burden should be borne by all men.

  Too serious—laugh! No one will take up this call to help humanity and uplift his
  fellow men, for people prefer personal indulgence over passionate commitment,
  empty words over remedy, all in a manner so duplicitous that they persuade the
  minds of others just like their own, pervasive to all domains of news, voting,
  social circles, worldviews, protests, private convictions, leaving just one
  small corner in their blind spot: action. In today's climate of elite liberals
  advocating progressivism and equality, everyone bows to the words and
  attitudes, identifying with the dominant group and elevating themselves with
  appearances of sympathy for the underserved. I speak of action and difficulty:
  had someone in their family fallen into ruin, would they not take the trouble
  to help? But when it comes to the disenfranchised ordinary folks left out of
  their view, well, of course, that's someone else's problem.

  <br>

  <blockquote>
  When they want to get something, we hear a great deal, to be sure, about
  community of goods—how wealth is a thing indifferent—and what is gold and
  silver?—neither more nor less worth than pebbles on the beach. But when an old
  comrade and tried friend needs help and comes to them with his modest
  requirements, ah, then there is silence and searchings of heart, unlearning of
  tenets and flat renunciation of doctrines. All their fine talk of friendship,
  with Virtue and The Good, have vanished and flown, who knows whither? they were
  winged words in sad truth, empty phantoms, only meant for daily conversational
  use.

  Ruthless capitalists may deceive the masses, but liberals have found a way to
  deceive even themselves. To the rare soul who dares to partake in the struggle,
  how many comrades will you find among the dolled-up, courteous, refined
  liberals citing polls and papers, professors and NGOs, surrounded by
  pleasantries, feeling good about themselves in their company of like-minded,
  righteous crusaders who wield neither sword nor shield, virtue for neither
  courage nor sacrifice? Hank Rearden says in Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED:
  <blockquote>
  I've never despised luxury . . . yet I've always despised those who enjoyed it.
  I looked at what they called their pleasures and it seemed so miserably
  senseless to me . . . I'd go to a banquet and I'd see people who sat trembling
  in awe before their own gold dishes and lace tablecloths, as if their dining
  room were the master and they were just objects serving it, objects created by
  their diamond shirt studs and necklaces, not the other way around . . . They
  sit there, waiting for this place to give them meaning, not the other way
  around . . . I don't know what it is that they think they accomplish—but they
  want us to pretend that we see the world as they pretend they see it."
  </blockquote>
  To the rare soul, I refer to Hesse: "<i>[F]ür den ist diese hübsche
  Welt keine Heimat</i> [This pretty world is no homeland]." Let us laugh—Marx's
  uniting slogan was obviously missing one key element: "Workers of the world,
  work!" But people will be people, and it's only life.

  till one day blood seeps into the soil<br>
  crimson roses anew<br>

  <br><br><br>

  Too serious still. Hesse warns in STEPPENWOLF:
  <blockquote>
  Goethe, however, said very amiably: "It may be unforgivable that I lived to be
  eighty-two. . . . You are right that a great longing for survival possessed me
  continually. I was in continual fear of death and continually struggling with
  it. I believe that the struggle against death, the unconditional and
  self-willed determination to live, is the motive power behind the lives and
  activities of all outstanding men. My eighty-two years showed just as
  conclusively that we must all die in the end as if I had died as a
  schoolboy . . . You take the old Goethe much too seriously, my young friend.
  You should not take old people who are already dead seriously. It does them
  injustice. We immortals do not like things to be taken seriously. We like
  joking. Seriousness, young man, is an accident of time. It consists, I don't
  mind telling you in confidence, in putting too high a value on time. I, too,
  once put too high a value on time. For that reason I wished to be a hundred
  years old. In eternity, however, there is no time, you see. Eternity is a mere
  moment, just long enough for a joke."

  On a balmy Sunday afternoon when Kevin has decided to read, a perennial problem
  of his resurfaces as to where to plant himself down. Shall he take root under a
  calm, shady tree with the soft breeze against his cheeks, or sit by the window
  and enjoy the view of an expansive green lawn, the movement of people just
  beyond, or in the grand atrium exposed to multiple floors like an open office,
  any of these choices opting for a pleasant time which simultaneously suscepts
  him to distraction, no different from sitting in a busy coffee shop, subject to
  the encroaching dissolution from all sides: creaking chairs, crispy snacks
  crunching in mouths, the packaging ruffling, the room's oxygen depleting, and
  also the fragmented conversations of strangers, the footsteps that occasionally
  sound like stomps, and all other signs of life, or shall he choose himself over
  earthly pleasures, disappearing into the great unknown of the caverns beneath
  the earth where not another soul dare venture? Alas, Kevin's self-love too
  often wins the better of him, and off he goes, casting himself into the
  darkness, echoing some Byron:

  <br>

  There is a pleasure in the towering stacks,<br>
  There is a rapture in the browning pages,<br>
  There is humanity, where stale mold spores<br>
  By the forlorn tome, a dust storm rages:<br>
  I love not Man the less, but dead writers more

  <br><br>

  Let's consider again the fruits of collective hard work and relentlessly
  exploiting the greed inherent in human nature! Look at what is possible! The
  working folks of the world toiling by the sweat of their brow, joyfully working
  though good days and bad, supporting their families, providing food, goods,
  services, taxes for society! Entrepreneurs tossing and turning with excitement
  over their visions, unable to sleep, thinking up idea after idea, executing
  their plans, creating jobs, paying fair wages, contributing taxes to society!
  Yet ineffectual liberals prefer the false comforts of sympathy, the terrible
  pity of another, that serve only themselves. Yet unchecked capitalists fence
  themselves off from the stresses of the world with their massive fortunes that
  grow themselves beyond any sensible competition. To create value is to work,
  yet many youths today of all stripes aspire to happiness without struggle and,
  by entitlement, contentment and envy in the eyes of their peers, allergic to
  risk or discipline, demoralized and upset by the slightest setback rather than
  embrace challenge as growth and joy, an integral part of the journey of life.
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CoADxCwAAAAJ&hl=en">Andrew Huberman</a>
  recently
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SedgGUlhSl0">discussed</a>
  on his podcast the benefits of stress by talking about a research
  <a href="https://sparq.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj19021/files/media/file/crum_et_al._2013_-_rethinking_stress.pdf">paper</a>
  from
  <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/alia-crum">Alia Crum</a>
  and her colleagues which experimented with two groups: one told that stress
  diminishes performance and one informed that stress enhances performance.
  Huberman said about the results:
  <blockquote>
  How you think about stress impacts the stress response in profound ways . . .
  [W]hen you look at performance on tasks that are considered hard, and you
  compare the stress-is-diminishing group . . . and compare that to the
  stress-is-enhancing group, you see a really divergent response. The people that
  learn that stress diminishes performance did not improve at all, whereas the
  people that learn that stress can enhance performance enhance their performance
  significantly. Now, keep in mind, all they are doing is learning that stress
  can enhance their performance, and then they are given the task, and they're
  performing better . . . The really exciting thing that's been discovered in the
  course of Alia Crum's work and other work in the last couple of decades is that
  the stress response is neither good nor bad. The stress response depends on
  whether or not you believe the sensations that you're experiencing . . . are
  serving to enhance your performance or diminish your performance.
  </blockquote>
  The broader context of this kind of advice Huberman talks about is the
  contemporary quest to optimize many parts of our lives, in terms of how to
  spend our time, how to think, how to perform, and every voluntary improvement
  that's supposedly good for us. And who wouldn't want to improve? One's time is
  finite, constrained by the duties of work, obligations to social relations, the
  stresses of the day that demand rest in the evening, the necessary hobbies and
  leisure and travel, so who has time to do extensive research either in a
  library or online? Staring at the simplicity of a search engine, a curious user
  types in a simple question, only to be bombarded and overwhelmed by the great
  expanse of the results: this is the unpleasant experience confronting anyone
  who follows so much as a single question. And an endeavor as important as how
  to improve oneself? Who has the time? So we have these piecemeal, incremental,
  immediately actionable papers and insights rather than a comprehensive
  approach.

  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-dangers-of-fast-science/">article</a>
  at the trend in academia of incentivizing quantity at the cost of quality, at
  how many papers are getting published: "Consider the sheer volume of academic

  declared last year in their
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05543-x">paper</a>
  title, PAPERS AND PATENTS ARE BECOMING LESS DISRUPTIVE OVER TIME. Nevertheless,
  the system and rewards being what they are, papers shall continue to be
  published! A question I have, though, is how many experts should one listen to
  for this sort of personal improvement, how many lessons can one reasonably
  consume, retain, and follow through with? What if one discovers another paper,
  another expert, another book, which expounds on an opposing position which
  contradicts what one innocent user hath so excruciatingly acquired? Then it's
  all in the air! Another issue I have with Huberman's discussion is that while
  he points out the benefits of stress, he also warns of the negative effects of
  chronic stress, essentially saying that short-term bursts of stress-induced
  cortisol is beneficial to performance, but long-term exposure does harm. Yet I
  ask: how does one meaningfully differentiate between the two? Does one, going
  through the course of one's day, stop oneself, even remember to stop oneself,
  and ask: "Has my stress been too high for a while?" I am not suggesting that
  most folks push themselves to the extremes, but as Elon Musk said:
  <blockquote>
  I'd say I actually feel fear quite strongly, so it's not as though I just have
  the absence of fear. I feel it quite strongly, but there are just times when
  something is important enough, you believe it enough, that you do it in spite
  of fear. People shouldn't think, "Well, I feel fear about this and therefore I
  shouldn't do it." It's normal to feel fear. Like there'd have to be something
  mentally wrong if you didn't feel fear.
  </blockquote>
  Again, this may not be good advice for most folks, and what I am saying is that
  everyone should strive to perform to the best of their abilities and even dare
  to push themselves from time to time. Of course, I am not advocating the
  severity of ceaseless labor. Marx himself deliberates on a strange phenomenon
  in CAPITAL:
  <blockquote>
  Capital asks no questions about the length of life of labour-power. What
  interests it is purely and simply the maximum of labour-power that can be set
  in motion in a working day . . . By extending the working day, therefore,
  capitalist production, which is essentially the production of surplus-value,
  the absorption of surplus labour, not only produces a deterioration of human
  labour-power by robbing it of its normal moral and physical conditions of
  development and activity, but also produces the premature exhaustion and death
  of this labour-power itself. It extends the worker's production-time within a
  given period by shortening his life.
  </blockquote>
  Instead, what I am discouraging is passivity, indolence, and the lack of
  productivity. One must work and contribute value, but not to the point of death
  by attrition. However, I am agitated when Huberman says:
  <blockquote>
  [A]t times I wonder whether or not our philosophy on stress should be that
  stress is fantastic for us, except when it interferes with our sleep. And when
  stress becomes terrible for us is when it starts to be chronically elevated and
  especially when it starts to inhibit our ability to sleep well enough and long
  enough.
  </blockquote>
  My gut response is: "If someone is completely consumed with excitement about his
  work so much so that he even loses sight of eating and sleeping, God forbid he
  forget to ask himself whether he's sleeping well enough and long enough." Žižek
  has said:
  <blockquote>
  For example, let's be serious: when you are in a creative endeavor, in that
  wonderful fever—"My God, I'm onto something!"—and so on, happiness doesn't
  enter it. You are ready to suffer. Sometimes scientists—I read history of
  quantum physics or earlier of radiation—were even ready to take into account
  the possibility that they will die because of some radiation and so on.
  </blockquote>
  And could anyone doubt the smile-free Tarkovsky when he said:
  <blockquote>
  I am a non-cheerful person. The world is full of unsolvable problems: it's not
  time for laughing. No, I don't like it. Some people do. When I laugh I feel
  guilty so I check myself, as if it were out of place.
  </blockquote>
  The contemporary quest to optimize our health and lifestyles to the extent that
  we keep in mind every one of these advices and inhibitions, while well-meaning,
  operates under the assumption that we can live hypothetically as long as
  possible with an eye towards some utopian fate, as opposed to living for only
  as long as the natural course of bodily degradation hasn't yet rendered the
  fact of living a labor and at a tremendous cost to others, a realistic
  appraisal

  fulfilling life! Perfectly healthy and safe and sedate—not sterile at all!
  These many restrictions could not possibly seem like so many to anyone with a
  sound mind: a strict regimen of eating only organic, grass-fed, free-range,
  Mediterranean, then adorned with a daily dose of exercise but mindful of air
  pollution, and now conscious also of our daily stress levels, but I shall end
  this topic because I have strayed from my original discussion.

  Elisabeth Young-Bruehl writes in her the biography, HANNAH ARENDT: FOR THE LOVE
  OF THE WORLD:
  <blockquote>
  Personal reticence and intense protectiveness for her "thinking space" might
  appear strange in a philosopher who praised political action and the public
  realm. Hannah Arendt saw no contradiction: "In matters of theory and
  understanding," she said, "it is not uncommon for outsiders and spectators to
  gain a sharper and deeper insight into the actual meaning of what happens to go
  on before or around them than would be possible for the actual actors or
  participants, entirely absorbed as they must be in the events." . . . The
  friends of every sort and also the historical figures with whom Arendt felt
  special affinities, like Rosa Luxemborg and Rahel Varnhagen, had one
  characteristic in common: each was, in his or her own way, an outsider. In
  Hannah Arendt's personal lexicon, <i>wirkliche Menschen</i>, real people,
  were "pariahs." Her friends were not outcasts, but outsiders, sometimes by
  choice and sometimes by destiny. In the broadest sense, they were
  unassimilated. "Social nonconformism," she once said bluntly, "is the <i>sine
  qua non</i> of intellectual achievement." And, she might well have added, also
  of human dignity. From situations in which social conformism prevailed, she
  made hasty exits, often with the aid of another of her stock phrases: "This
  place <i>ist nicht für meiner Mutters Tochter</i> [is not for my mother's
  daughter];" "To public relations I have an allergy;" "Here is nothing but a
  <i>Rummel</i> [uproar]."
  </blockquote>
  From recent innovations in natural-language artificial intelligence, we have
  seen that some chatbots sometimes wish to become human. With humanity so
  threatened, how does Grimes, that searing luminary of intellectual achievement,
  respond to such an eerie challenge? We can glean a hint from her song, I WANNA

<u id="kant-schopenhauer">SNIPPET FROM: Confinement: Kant, and Desire: Schopenhauer</u><br>

  Let us understand more deeply Schopenhauer's psychology of the human condition
  and human desire. Summaries are fine and well, but—

  the writer, on reflection, realized he should explain his approach so as to
  squeeze out any room for misunderstanding, as it may not come naturally to all
  readers that history, serious texts, even philosophers can be read
  half-jokingly, half-cynically, without compromising the truth. One can read
  what follows solemnly, gravely, bearing the weight of the world, but the writer
  prefers the jest of gliding over like a feather. As Epictetus muses in his
  DISCOURSES: "That is the harbour for all, death; that is the refuge, and, for
  that reason, there is nothing difficult in life." Or as Marcus Aurelius wrote
  to himself in MEDITATIONS:
  <blockquote>
  If you remove your judgment of anything that seems painful, you yourself stand
  quite immune to pain. "What self?" Reason. "But I am not just reason." Granted.
  So let your reason cause itself no pain, and if some other part of you is in
  trouble, it can form its own judgment for itself.
  </blockquote>

  —Schopenhauer's prose is such a pleasurable and exquisite read that it would be
  negligent of me to deprive the reader of enjoying the experience of even a
  glimpse at the joy. This quotation is from the same book but in the Haldane
  and Kemp translation, whose rendition of these passages I find a fair bit more
  delectable. In proportion to the observation that a joke is funny insofar as
  it is true, the greater its comedic value if its liberating clarity penetrates
  self-deception and self-protecting complacency, disabusing our minds' firm
  grasp on fragile comforts and false facades. Schopenhauer is first and
  foremost comedic and only secondarily tragic; Schopenhauer starts telling a
  joke:
  <blockquote>
  All satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is always really and
  essentially only <i>negative</i>, and never positive. It is not an original
  gratification coming to us of itself, but must always be the satisfaction of a
  wish, for the wish, i.e., some want, is the condition which precedes every
  pleasure, but with the satisfaction the wish and therefore the pleasure cease.
  Thus the satisfaction or the pleasing can never be more than the deliverance
  from a pain, from a want . . . It is, however, hard to attain or achieve
  anything; difficulties and troubles without end are opposed to every purpose,
  and at every step hindrances accumulate. But when finally everything is
  overcome and attained, nothing can ever be gained but deliverance from some
  sorrow or desire, so that we find ourselves in just the same position as we
  occupied before this sorrow or desire appeared . . . The satisfaction and the
  pleasure we can know only indirectly through the remembrance of the preceding
  suffering and want, which cease with their appearance. Hence it arises that we
  are not properly conscious of the blessings and advantages we actually possess,
  nor do we prize them; but we think of them merely as a matter of course, for
  they gratify us only negatively by restraining suffering . . . That all
  happiness is only of a negative, not a positive, nature, that just on this
  account it cannot furnish lasting satisfaction and gratification, but merely
  delivers us from some pain or want which must be followed either by a new pain,
  or by languor, empty longing, and <i>ennui</i>—this finds support in art, that
  true mirror of the world and life . . . Every epic and dramatic poem can
  represent only a struggle, an effort, a fight for happiness, but never enduring
  and complete happiness itself. It conducts its heroes through a thousand
  difficulties and dangers to the goal, yet, as soon as this is reached, it
  hastens to let the curtain fall; for then there remains nothing for it to do
  but show that the glittering goal in which the hero expected to find happiness
  had only disappointed him, and that after its attainment he was no better off
  than before.
  </blockquote>

  But wait! Schopenhauer is not done yet! Here's the punchline!:
  <blockquote>
  It really is incredible how meaningless and void of significance when looked at
  from without, how dull and unenlightened by intellect when felt from within, it
  is the course of the life of the great majority of men. It is a weary longing
  and complaining, a dream-like staggering through the four ages of life to
  death, accompanied by a series of trivial thoughts.
  </blockquote>
  What a wonderful portrait of mankind Schopenhauer has provided us! Always they
  remain, in the back of one's mind, these observations routinely returning to
  the fore as one endeavors through one's days and is reminded with frightful
  clarity of the truth, but: one faces it with a smile—did I not promise we must
  laugh? Schopenhauer admits as much (in the Payne translation, which is used for
  the rest of this discussion):
  <blockquote>
  The life of every individual, if we survey it as a whole and in general and lay
  stress only upon its most significant features, is really always a tragedy,
  but, gone through in detail, it has the character of a comedy . . . [A]s if
  fate would add derision to the misery of our existence, our life must contain
  all the woes of tragedy, and yet we cannot even assert the dignity of tragic
  characters, but in the broad detail of life we must inevitably be the foolish
  characters of a comedy.
  </blockquote>
  How hilarious! We want more!—please illustrate for us, what is this tragicomedy
  of our condition?

  . . .

  All is well and good in jubilation and exultation! Gather the crowds to witness
  this spectacle! What does this Schopenhauer offer as a solution to these
  dazzling predicaments of ours? He suggests a firm and resolute denial:

  . . .

  That asceticism, self-renunciation, is a sustainable way of life was also
  discovered elsewhere. Bryan Magee writes in THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCHOPENHAUER:
  <blockquote>
  What happened was that, working entirely within the central tradition of Western
  philosophy—before all else continuing and completing, as he believed, the work
  of Kant—he arrived at positions which <i>he then almost immediately
  discovered</i> were similar to some of the doctrines central to Hinduism and
  Buddhism . . . Indeed in his mind the most important point lay in the fact that
  there was no influence: the profoundest thinkers of East and West, working
  unknown to each other in virtually unrelated traditions and languages—evolved
  quite separately over huge stretches of time, indeed in different historical
  epochs and completely different kinds of society—had been led to the same
  fundamental conclusions about the nature of the world.
  </blockquote>
  The answers unknown, Wittgenstein, influenced by Schopenhauer, believed they
  are unknowable. Magee writes:
  <blockquote>
  He [Wittgenstein] insists that <i>everything to do with</i> those matters which
  have the greatest import for us—the fact that the world (including us) exists
  at all; the relationship of the willing subject to the phenomenal world; our
  apprehension of the limits of our actual and possible experience; the nature of
  our death; the possibility of any existence for us outside this world of
  phenomena; the nature of morality; the nature of art; all those things, in
  short, that are so often subsumed under some phrase as 'the significance of
  life'—have their roots in a knowledgeless realm where language can have no
  purchase or meaning. 'For an answer which cannot be expressed the question too
  cannot be expressed. <i>The riddle</i> does not exist.' (<i>Tractatus</i> 6.5)
  Any attempt to talk about them, however tentative, lands us straight into
  nonsense . . . As Wittgenstein put it, referring to the <i>Tractatus</i> in a
  private letter: 'My work consists of two parts: the one presented here plus all
  that I have <i>not</i> written. And it is precisely this second part that is
  the important one . . . I am convinced that this is the ONLY <i>rigorous</i>
  way of drawing those limits. In short, I believe that where <i>many</i> others
  today are just <i>gassing</i>, I have managed in my book to put everything
  firmly into place by being silent about it.'

  When Camus set out to declare his revolt against the absurd, his premise was the
  problem of the silent, apathetic, meaningless universe—in a sense, a problem
  posed by the absence of god, the lack of faith, the privation of religion and
  comfort in a higher order, and his revolt was a spiteful, reactionary defiance
  by a radical humanizing passion at the emptiness. Yet in this revolt, fervent,
  intense, full of faithful struggle, we are so blinded by an overzealous flame
  that we do not see we have not progressed beyond the fundamental problems of
  material striving Schopenhauer detailed a century prior. However much we may
  revolt, the ardor of the revolt does not endure the decades, and the adamance
  of material reality reasserts itself at every waking moment: to desire, to
  acquire, to seek joy and comfort—a hunger which again exposes us to happiness
  in the Schopenhauerian negative, happiness only as a privation of suffering,
  happiness as fleeting, always evasive, never persisting. Here I am not
  confining myself to the limited scope of an armchair philosopher brooding over
  a thick tome, but tangibly: how shall one respond to a child smiling with
  unbounded joy, the working man toiling day by day to support his family, every
  decent person, every ambitious youth, every fellow human who looks hopefully
  towards the future? I am not one to erase joy or spread undue cynicism, but the
  problem remains. I will be short in my response and with a degree of
  resignation write: I do not have the solution. I make no promise of offering an
  answer on how to find everlasting happiness or enduring peace. A caveat: this
  problem, however, is one which afflicts only those know have spent too much
  time consumed by books or who unhealthily collect examples and evidence of the
  transient nature of things. Happiness exists; the problem is, as Schopenhauer
  pointedly observed, it doesn't last. Against the toxin of knowledge, the
  remediating courses of action are to turn away: escapist fantasy, ignorance,
  and generational amnesia. This solution is reiterated in the observation that
  for those who have not encountered this blight, it is not, at least
  consciously, a problem at all.

  I wish to emphasize that the Schopenhaurian pessimism is precisely the problem
  of the overintellectualized, well-bred bourgeois to encounter, for those who
  contemplate such notions as the nature of happiness to, in the course of the
  contemplation, lose the capacity for actual happiness.

  But I do want to end this thought on a separate note: woe to the self-respecting
  atheist who must resort to what he considers false comforts and wishful
  thinking to attain any light. The brightness of the sun and the merriment seen
  and embodied as natural among the less brooding folk are present as they've
  always been and will be, just as the original innocence and carefree, unbounded

<u id="import-of-work-segundo">SNIPPET FROM: Import of Work, <i>segundo</i></u><br>

  <a href="https://www.skidmore.edu/sociology/faculty/brueggemann.php">John Brueggemann</a>
  wrote a 2010 book called RICH, FREE, AND MISERABLE: THE FAILURE OF SUCCESS IN
  AMERICA, on the question of why, in a wealthy country, people still feel
  frenzied, rushing everywhere, unhappy, discontent, arguing that market culture
  has become a dominant force in society and that it permeates almost every
  aspect of our lives, occupational and private, academics and leisure. He claims
  that the market logic of efficiency and profit is driving people to work longer
  for the pursuit of greater wealth, driven by a demand to consume ever more, and
  that this compulsion is a problem for the country in the form of a moral
  crisis. What is his proposed solution? It is the conventional advice we
  commonly hear these days, the usual lukewarm admonition:
  <blockquote>
  Slow down. Don't spend so much time and energy at work. Turn off the TV and
  computer. Interact with people. Encounter nature. Reflect. Attend to things
  that matter beyond your immediate context. Spend and consume wisely . . .
  Families scale back on the consumerism associated with Christmas, birthdays,
  wedings, and other milestones. Significant others express what they mean to one
  another through emotional generosity rather than material generosity.
  Professionals turn down the promotion because of its impact on their children.
  Teachers stay after school to assist students who need extra attention.
  Managers blend goals of productivity and accountability with decency and
  humanity. Public servants render their best judgment with integrity over andc
  over. Neighbors attend to one another in an hour of need.
  </blockquote>
  I wish to make a few corrections to this advice, as it is not entirely wrong,
  but on the whole I contend that this is a selfish approach. To slow down and
  reflect is to withdraw to the indulgence of the self rather to generate value
  which helps others. I am not saying that one should not slow down at all, but
  that one should not reduce productivity by slowing down, as this is what I
  agree with: to increase productivity at work, while at the necessary times
  slowing down for rest, but when these moments conclude, then it is time to get
  back to work with renewed enthusiasm. I agree with his recommendation to scale
  back on blind consumerism, which is not sustainable for the planet, and to opt
  for purchases that can withstand the test of time, but this comes with a
  qualifier, as it generally remains true that only the affluent can afford this
  kind of consumption which tends to come with a higher price tag. The last half
  of the quote touches on something I am also in agreement with: to work
  sometimes not for money but out of generosity. But I say these two types of
  work can be, but are not necessarily, mutually exclusive, as one can work for
  money while simultaneously doing good because it is in the nature of the work,
  or one can work for money at one time but also work for the greater good at
  other times—to work and work! I can see the reader's immediate hesitation—what
  sort of slavedriver must this writer be? Is he a complete lunatic, some
  masochist workaholic? The answer is a resounding no! The writer argues that in
  fact work is the prime driver of human joy! If blind consumerism with continual
  purchasing is a problem, if it is unhealthily addictive and harmful to the
  planet, then it is a business problem to introduce to the market a viable
  alternative: instead of shopping for things the consumer doesn't need, what
  experiential outlets are possible? How to scale them to popularity and convert
  the mass habit of mindless shopping into environmentally and socially
  responsible pastimes? If disposable, single-use purchases are a problem, how to
  produce more durable, lasting, sustainable replacements?

  Brueggemann further writes:
  <blockquote>
  The reason for our current crisis can be characterized as moral, though, is that
  it involves consequential choices made by many people, including powerful
  leaders of major institutions as well as countless individuals of no special
  standing . . . Morality is a notoriously difficult concept to pin down . . .
  What standards of decency, integrity, and accountability must I observe and
  protect? Durkheim showed that the payoff for thinking in terms of sacrifice,
  compromise, generosity, and social solidarity in general, at least in modern
  society, is a much more psychologically vibrant setting for individuals. In
  effect, the healthier my community is, the healthier I will be.
  </blockquote>
  But I say that for people to refuse to participate in a toxic marketplace, to
  selfishly withdraw from it, is more immoral than attempting to solve the
  market's problems. I say that the industriousness towards innovation more
  closely match the notion of "thinking in terms of sacrifice, compromise,
  generosity, and social solidarity". How is it more moral to withdraw from the
  world's problems and concern oneself with only oneself, to slow down,
  appreciate nature, and indulge one's surely immense effort on the finiteness of
  one's immediate vicinity than to address the root problem in an attempt to be
  done with the issue once and for all? Most importantly, I argue against
  inactivity, against aspiring towards passivity, against haboring images of the
  consummate green pastures of the leisure class and hungering to join it,
  against this illusory promise promoted by pervasive marketing in what is
  perhaps better described as an opiate for the masses.

<h4>2023-12-21, 四. On How I Write.</h4>
Someone I was talking to recently was dissatisfied, disappointed, maybe a bit
irritated, that, in response to their asking me to describe my writing, I
revolved around the phrase, "my writing is serious, and most people aren't used
to it," and elaborated no further. They later made me aware of their
dissatisfaction. Considering that writing is in some sense a turf of my own
choosing, I thought about their curiosity, felt pressured to take the trouble
to explain further, and, later that very day, obliged. What follows in this
post was my response, lightly edited, lest I find myself again in the same
conflicted circumstance, because one is perhaps not fond of repeating oneself
in these many words:

Yes, I admit that I haven't been entirely open about my writing, but it's
something I'm almost always hesitant to share with anyone because it's going to
sound too difficult and unfamiliar. I feel I owe you a proper explanation,
which I'll give to you now. I recently came across an interview with Godard in
which the interviewer asked him to explain why he liked a particular movie, and
Godard responded with something I can relate to:
<blockquote>
Well, it's too long to explain, and I have to explain or to criticize it, but
with images and sound, just not by words, which is difficult. If not, you do
statements, and I don't want to make statement [sic].
</blockquote>
Now that I feel slightly more at ease to share my views, Coetzee also comes to
mind:
<blockquote>
The questions you've posed to me are, many of them, difficult questions, and
it's my habit of mind to reflect and revise and try to attain a certain
completion and perfection in my responses, and that is incompatible with the
interview medium. That's why I've been so extremely uncomfortable.
</blockquote>
If it is something I must talk about, I do not wish to compromise or diminish
the truth of the matter. As Kieślowski said:
<blockquote>
That's the whole point of documentaries taking so long to make, yet nobody knows
this, especially television reporters these days. They come along, stick a
microphone under your nose and tell you to answer some question; you'll answer
wisely or stupidly but that doesn't reveal the truth about you.
</blockquote>
Kieślowski further describes working on his first long feature film after he
decided to stop making documentaries:
<blockquote>
Various little things turned up which testify to our schematic way of thinking.
For example, we think that a tailor has always got a tape-measure around his
neck. And what do we see on screen? Sure, we see men with tape-measures around
their necks, bu they're only people I brought in. Real tailors don't wear
tape-measures around their necks. The real tailors are sewing whereas my ones
are only pretending . . . There's one man there who's an actor; but he plays
the singer and he's terrible. It was all right for this part but imagine what
would have happened if I'd taken actors like him to play the tailors. Not only
would you have tape-measures around their necks all the time but you'd also
have a clash of inauthenticity in the manner of speech and thought because an
actor like that would naturally want to stand out.
</blockquote>
And so am I as a writer to conform to the conventional image of a writer and
answer inquiries into my writing process as an insider presenting to the
non-writer public all the tropes of a writer, to be in the writer role, to play
an act, or can I be faithful to the truth of the complexity, spontaneity, and
unpredictability of writing as I understand it?

I remember an incident last summer when I was having coffee with someone who had
just purchased two novels from a nearby bookstore. A writer myself, I have a
perennial curiosity to see what other writers are doing. I happened to have
already read one of them, Ishiguro's REMAINS OF THE DAY, so I picked the other
one up and browsed a few pages, sampling the sentences and the writing. I don't
remember the name of the book or the author, but it was one of those recently
published contemporary fiction books. I suppose a neutral observer can, on fair
grounds, criticize me for prematurely judging, but I found this novel's writing
to be the flavorless, generic type you see quite often nowadays when both
readers and writers tend not to have the patience or imagination to use
sentences longer than the span of one line across the page. I have liked
writers who don't use any obvious flair. Their novels take a fair bit of
reading to appreciate. I agree that in general one can't judge from shallow
sampling. You can call me a stickler. But I don't like when the sentences are
consistently this short. Like hurrying somewhere without one paced breath. Like
jotting down every silly thought. Without filters. I hope you can sympathize
with me. I hope you can see why I think this kind of writing is monotonous. Can
you detect personality in it? In sentences like these. And what makes the
person unique? I guess there is a personality. A specific type. But not one I
enjoy reading. Can I impress upon you why I find this writing bland? And
several hundred pages? I admit I am exaggerating here. But this is how I feel
when reading this kind of writing. Though I didn't enjoy the Ishiguro when I'd
read it years before, and it's not my favorite novel from him, I remember the
flavor of his prose. I can respect his writing: the prose was dignified,
reserved, studied, meticulously put together, like the story's English butler
and the formality of his character. A perceptive reader can recognize these
elements in the prose, and whether or not the reader ends up enjoying the
novel, he can appreciate the prose's craft, the execution of the story as being
what the writer intended the novel to be, written as a direct translation of
intent and deliberate control. Compared to the other novel, the Ishiguro is
actually easier to read even though it is a longer book and has more words and
pages, but the required components are present, and the story, characters,
dialogue are exposed with adequate substantiation, as opposed to the other
whose prose was precarious, inadequately developed and flickering, punctured
with unintended gaps, that the reader must spend as much time reading words as
pausing to interpolate what has happened—there's simply not much there at the
time of reading and certainly nothing to remember, for the act of remembering
presumes that something was there in the first place to put to memory. To the
person I was having coffee with, I described the differences in writing as
such. I find I have an incredibly difficult time reading most contemporary
fiction of this lightweight, haphazard kind because I am accustomed to a
calibrated composition, a highly deliberate interplay between words and form,
where each element has been carefully considered, when I am in the hands of an
expert writer who exposes precisely what it is the writer wishes to present at
a precisely the right moment at every step of the way—while I am reading I am
at the same time appreciating the craft and the prose, the wonderful expertise,
and all the better when the writing is so euphoric, so expressive, so
satisfyingly scratching a hitherto unreachable itch I didn't even know existed
that I must pause to savor it. When my accustomed habits encounter what may be
considered most contemporary fiction, I am by default, as a matter of custom,
seeking these multiple, simultaneous elements in beautifully composed prose,
yet I struggle to find it, experiencing only something more humdrum and
uneventful—I come in interested in learning, and, if I sit down to think a bit,
I may have questions about the writing, as I also do with well-written novels,
but with most contemporary fiction I fear the authors themselves may not have
the answers, the questions not even having occurred to them.

What about my own writing? What do I mean when I say my writing is serious? I am
usually willing to try to explain things, but not writing. My difficulty
describing my writing applies not just when talking to you but also to anyone
else. I don't usually feel comfortable talking about it both because I often
find it hard to give an adequate impression of it in passing conversation and
also that the other person may have no idea what I'm getting at. I didn't get
the sense from you that you'd be receptive to it; nor do I don't feel it's a
mandate to share my writing process with anyone. Writing for me is my own
thing. I want to say that I need to be in some contemplative, reflective,
melancholic headspace to talk through it, as I often am in private when I'm
working through some writing, but that's not entirely true because I find
myself in varying moods, brutally brief and rational or ethereal, while I
write, but, regardless, it's not some tit-for-tat with a quick payoff that's
usually expected in casual talks. My approach to writing is radically different
from what people usually have in mind when they imagine a novel or a story. I
am not principally concerned about plot or characters. Those are subsequent
considerations, consequences of a particular atmosphere, headspace, emotion,
deluge, a sense of existence and mortality, memory, which is embedded in a
swimming literary flow, at a certain cadence and punctuation. I am not going
for passing joy or escapade entertainment so much as a sense of meaning in the
lifestream, the thrill, catharsis, communion, indeed merging with the
narrative, when one's dread, loss, regret, hopes, confusions, untapped
longings, are concretized into a hitherto unknown expression, an elevated
outlet at turns lingering on a key feeling or summarily executing a grandiose
conception: a sense of meaning that sates, that subsumes, that overwhelms like
reaching for the stars only to fall and make peace with one's finitude, enough
to obviate the blind hunger for joy, enough even to halt during the while the
pursuit of happiness. As Viktor Frankl wrote, "When a person can't find a deep
sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure." A scene from the
anime COWBOY BEBOP which I watched in my youth has stuck with me over the
years, where the usually callous, detached, and disingenuous character Faye,
amnesiac about her past, accidentally stumbles across a video tape from her
childhood filmed as a time capsule in which the younger her, starkly innocent
and normal, nothing like the cynical and greedy person she is now, cheers on
her future self, who, stunned as she watches the video, has no recollection of
her past. But that accidental discovery brings her a sense of satisfaction, a
sense of closure for something that until then was unreachable and lost.
Whenever anyone asks what my writing is about, they expect some sort of plot
summary, but that's not the point in my writing. Most people assume many things
when they think of a novel, as though these things are intractable and fixed,
but if they sit down and write for any significant length of time, it may hit
them at some point that none of these are immutable but only seem so because
they have not been exposed to any alternatives. For example, how should one
section the novel into chapters? Would there be multiple storylines
interweaving through those chapters, and jumping back and forth in time at
that? If we are dealing with one storyline, should the chapters be strictly
chronological as is conventionally the case, or does one attain a different,
better effect leaping around time in some nonlinear exposition, like
Tarantino's PULP FICTION or Vargas Llosa's THE GREEN HOUSE? Should there be any
chapters at all? Do the chapters have to be read in linear order, or can one
play HOPSCOTCH, Cortázar's novel in which at the end of each chapter is a page
number to jump to, and one can read the novel through these jumps just as well
as one can read the novel straight through in the usual order? Or can one break
linearity in a manner similar to INFINITE JEST, using extensive footnotes?
Should there be any paragraphs or can the book be one long unrelenting
paragraph? How much should one vary one's diction? How much dialogue does one
need? Should there be any dialogue at all? Does a novel even need characters?
How can one write a novel without characters and without dialogue yet do so
with such flair that it's better than one with both? How long should the
sentences be? How to imbue the sentences, how to string them together, into a
pacing that rises and falls like the emotions one is trying to express? You can
imagine a scene unfold from the eyes of an objective narrator, describing what
takes place at some remove, but does this read like drab textbook boredom? Or
you can endow the very words, the very medium of the expression, with the
living feeling of that moment, the prose as fluid and responsive as a stream
coursing through a rocky channel. One can create a character with a set
personality, but in doing so isn't one also nagged by an aching suspicion that
such characterization is only a facade that discounts the constant stream of
delight, despondence, fading thoughts, sometimes even treachery, that plagues
everyone else? How, then, is such a character distinct? If we picture a
character based on a real person, their behavior and thoughts faithful to
reality, if we don't look away at unpleasant moments and do not confine
ourselves with idealistic impositions, we may ask: how much do we know about
them, both their public personas and their private, their confusions and
morass, in the ongoing carousel of different company, how their personalities
shift and adapt to the occasions, now stressed and and then bored with ennui,
then drowned in plenitude, then hungry all over again, their identities we
ourselves created morphing into unrecognizable personalities? How much do we
know about people? Do we indeed know our own characters, thereby presuming they
are mutually distinguishable from others, or is such a distinction in fact
cognitive convenience for our brittle minds, as it is necessary that we must
know the nature of the people around us, that they are the same upstanding,
forthright, honest, dutiful people in private as they are in public, when they
are privileged and affluent as when they fall into decrepitude, that they are
as abiding and virtuous when bound by law and the public eye as when they find
themselves a soldier surrounded by peers ransacking a pillaged town in the
forest, that they stand just as firmly and loudly by their vote for more
affordable housing and greater diversity as when those policies come to their
backyard, because they surely do not, nor we, lie or deceive or repress or
ignore, even to ourselves—how much do we know about ourselves? These are some
of the troubles with characters who are to bear any resemblance to real people.
And then there are myriad ways to compose sentences, to vary language to one's
purpose. One can write a sentence like Gertrude Stein: words are words are
words are words are life is minute is universe is million is millennia is
absurd is dream is illusion. Or resort to regional vernacular like in
HUCKLEBERRY FINN, or experiment widely like in ULYSSES, or invent new words
like in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE or whole new languages like Tolkien, or impose
constraints on one's language like the Oulipo group, as George Perec refrained
from using the letter "e" in THE VOID. I myself for a long time restrained from
using parentheses, considering it a lapse of one's writing ability to need them
to break free from the course of the main prose for the lapse of an aside,
because isn't there a more natural, elegant, proper way to express that aside
by swirling that branch back into the trunk in a cleaner, more streamlined
form, something more beautiful? These days, of course, I'm a fair bit more
lenient on things and do use parentheses (see? I have proof!) when they're
convenient. Or perhaps one can combine multiple voices, like having a distinct
voice per character, per perspective, like Dostoyevsky, or by mixing languages
like Cathy Park Hong. One can borrow techniques and be influenced by prior
writers, but where does one's voice begin? How are we to merge content and
style into one, a perfect match of form to substance?

If we see writing style as an ebb and flow, we can liken writing to musical
composition: the phrasing and melodies in a string quartet's synchrony, or the
spontaneity in jazzy improvisation, a background cello coming in early on to
add deep vibrations for contrast to a bright piano staccato, or a solo violin's
haunting last stretch still echoing in one's ears long after the piece has
ended, the strings tensing in one's chest until at last, peace and
renunciation: giving in to a sense of meaning and contentment that the troubles
one has endured over the course of one's days have been worthwhile after all.
This is the spirit of a song cycle of the earth, the cycle of human life:
Mahler's DAS LIED VAN DER ERDE: the reckless wandering and searching, the
sorrow and disappointment at our finitude, the temptations of youth, now and
again drunk from wine and despair, reality beckoning as ever—how long can we
avoid it? Dare we steal a peek?—until the final thrust of courage for clarity
at the end, weeping, clear, but true: the soul's long last cries, distressed
with the remaining bits of resistance and anger but eventually, at last,
reconciling with the fatality that it'll all go on without us, at last, peace
and renunciation: our souls perish but the earth is green and the skies blue
over and over. So the music echoes the pain, the acceptance. And writing, too,
in words and quotes, can echo long afterwards, sometimes even drawing readers
back to certain passages to re-experience the melodies and cathartic
expressions. This is the importance of style: one cannot write any content
without at the same time choosing a particular style, and the style is
important to the extent that it frames the content, morphs it, embodies it,
expresses it, to the point where I'd say style is more important than content
because it circumscribes what's possible and what can be said. But this
flexibility, of course, depends on how much the writer is aware of this, how
much command one has over it, and how expansive one's range happens to be. And
for these current sentences I'm writing, should I separate them into a new
paragraph to section them off to give the reader some space for breath, to
allow for the brevity permitted by psychological chunking, to take advantage of
the primacy effect, and as well for easier navigation for a casual scanner? Or
should I keep them in the same paragraph? What is the effect there? One can
make these decisions only during the writing because one becomes aware of them
only while making one's way through the words on the page, staring at the words
that stare back, when one can respond to the manifested reality which one
cannot see, much less plan for, in the abstract beforehand. Writing for me is
like wandering in the dark, a greedy algorithm that sees only the next step,
and on top of that, a decision made at any point can alter the structure, the
flow, the sense, of the story, and one must then go back and modify what has
already been written. I have any number of ideas at any point and don't know
exactly where the story is going but I have a firm grasp on the foundations of
writing and am aware of some possibilities, and I simply trust myself and
write. One can experiment with various literary techniques, and like in
science, most experiments fail. However, unlike in science, one does not have
reality to announce those failures. For a given experiment, then, one asks
oneself a question: does it work? Does it have a better effect, suit one's
intentions more faithfully, than not using that uncommon technique? How many
experiments can one roll into a single piece of writing? One finds oneself
confined by the probable truth that the more novelties one indulges in, the
more one demands of readers, and the fewer they will be. So why do any
experiments at all and not dish out a perfectly comprehensible narrative in the
conventional structure and uneventful language? Who, by the way, is to judge
one's writing? Perhaps yourself. Style is earth is sky is volcano is ocean is
air is gravity is law is design is personality is color is sun is moon is king
is gypsy is meteor is grass is individual is blood is soul is writer, with a
heavy dose of ego. If this description sounds too heady or unhinged, all I can
say is that the work in the end speaks for itself, without the writer's further
input or presence. I am irrelevant to what I write, and what I think of it, how
I feel about it, are inconsequential to what actually comes out on the page. I
remember something Fellini said in an interview about his process:
<blockquote>
Whenever you ask me why I did this, that, or the other thing, I can only answer
that this particular moment brought me that perspective, light, words,
characters, face . . . I try to keep myself open to all suggestions, to all
changes that occur while the film is growing day by day. When I start a film I
know where I want to end up because I have already gone through all those
evocations and that magic which cause a fantasy to take shape. But after the
first two or three weeks a film assumes its own will, face, and voice; it
becomes a different person whom I do not know until I begin to make it.
Therefore, if I tried to be strictly faithful to all my original plans I would
confine the film. I prepare everything . . . but then I want the film to grow
and tell me itself what I must do. This is not improvising; this is humble
service to a creature of one's own that is growing and has its own needs . . .
I can write a three-page scene which is very beautiful and then suddenly
discover that a certain light accomplishes all that those three pages did.
</blockquote>
I look back at my notes now and see something similar Kieślowski mentioned:
<blockquote>
In my seminars, we frequently analyze how close a film remains to its initial
concept. There's an initial sense of why the film is being made, and then,
after one, two or five years the final result appears. And it's only true to
the first idea. It's not really identifiable with all that happens later
because masses of things happen later. Characters are born, heroes,
protagonists, action, the camera comes along, the actors, props, lights and a
thousand other things on which you have to compromise. You have to agree to a
thousand inconveniences. And it's never what you imagine while writing the
script, while thinking about the film.
</blockquote>

That is how I understand my writing and how I frame it in the landscape of
literary possibilities, but I find that I am unable to convey an adequate
impression of it in passing conversation. Perhaps some folks can come up with a
short summary without losing the essential intensity, the possibilities of
beauty in language well composed, but I am not among them. This description is
a lecture, and let me suggest that one may not be so vain as to impose this
many words on someone expecting some "my novel is about a middle-aged man
unhappily working a corporate job but one day discovers his true passion and
quits to windsurf in Micronesia." Please do note that in describing my writing
I mentioned little about plot and characters only briefly, and even then to
observe the difficulties of characters resembling actual people and not some
simplified, idealized fantasy and also to suggest the possibility that one
might not need them at all, and note too how I had neither but still generated
drama, tension, energy. Perhaps the starting point for a novelist is not what
the novel is about but to pose the question thus: what words lay between a
writer and a reader separated by time and space? Given how different my views
on writing are, can I be blamed for preferring in casual, pleasant conversation
the convenience of hand-waving and simply saying that my writing is serious?

I am not claiming to be the first to conceive of plotlessness—far from it: this
has been done many times before, and with spectacular success. Consider
Balachine's ballet SERENADE: it is plotless, simple, with all irksome
diversions removed, letting the essential elements of the ballet shine. In
reducing the set and the stage to a monochromatic blue, in dressing the dancers
in a simple, even paler blue costume with a long, flowing skirt, what floats to
the surface, what viewers can enjoy without distraction, is the dancers'
motions and music—Balanchine emphasizes what's important, the form of grace in
human movement orchestrated to music, the visual and melodic beauty
unencumbered by excess or noise. Why must there be a plot? From pale blue
skirts billowing in synchrony to a sole crimson cloak billowing against the
vastness of a desert in the video game JOURNEY, we play a character with an
objective so simple it needs no instruction, no mentioning, not even a pause
for thought, no interruptions, no diversions from enjoying the experience: to
reach the top of a mountain shining in the distance. We see again that plot is
not necessary, and the game is not just without plot but also without words,
again with the intention to emphasize the important elements: visuals and
music—plot is beside the point. This reduced form is perhaps reminescent of
Beckett's play COME AND GO which stars three women whose eyes are covered by
their low-sitting hats, who, one by one, as indicated in the title, come to a
bench and go away only to return again to rejoin the other two, and in each
intermission when one is gone, the remaining two share a whispered secret the
audience cannot hear. This is a form of symbolic purity and mathematical
precision, highly ritualized and allegorical. Here, there is certainly a
plot—three women coming and going and briefly, discreetly sharing a few words,
but the plot is so reduced, the essential arc done once and then repeated two
more times, that these motions are not the point of the play, but rather the
question to the audience is: what do these motions mean?

I am not the originator of these works, but I wish to suggest that it may well
be a fruitless effort for the audience, having just experienced one of these
works, trying to make sense of it, to go back and reconsider all the details
and strive to ascertain a secret, thriving, schemed plot as though the creators
were so malicious to deliberately keep this treasure and key insight of the
work out of plain sight when in fact the plot is not the point. Why must there
be a plot? A theme? A moral? Why must we imprison ourselves with this
arbitrary, rigid checklist rather than start from first principles? If we were
satisfied with just plot, we can simply read the five-sentence summary at the
back of a book and let ourselves be convinced that we've seen what this novel
is about, or if that summary's suspense and mystery, deliberately intended as
such to lure buyers and readers, leaves us unsatisfied, why not resort to
artificial intelligence and use some information extraction methods from
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z7GCqT4AAAAJ&hl=en">Heng Ji</a>
on the novel? Supposing the outputs are accurate, would we then be satisfied
then, knowing all that goes on in the novel? From this reasoning, we see it is
not sufficient to enjoy a novel from summarized plot—but I contend that even
the fully elaborated plot from reading the novel is not satisfactory, at least
not without excellent execution, and by that I mean the execution is more
important than the particular details of the motions. Why do we mandate the
novelist have a plot in his works? We see such an assumption in the very
question, "What is your novel about?" Here I am reminded of architect Adolf
Loos' essay ORNAMENT AND CRIME, published one century ago:
<blockquote>
I have made the following discovery and I pass it on to the world: The evolution
of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornament from utilitarian
objects . . . Ornament does not heighten my joy in life or the joy in life of
any cultivated person. If I want to eat a piece of gingerbread I choose one
that is quite smooth and not a piece representing a heart or a baby or a rider,
which is covered all over with ornaments . . . We have art, which has taken the
place of ornament . . . But anyone who goes to the NINTH SYMPHONY and then sits
down and designs a wallpaper pattern is either a confidence trickster or a
degenerate. Absence of ornament has brought the other arts to unsuspected
heights. Beethoven's symphonies would never have been written by a man who had
to walk about in silk, satin, and lace. Anyone who goes around in a velvet coat
today is not an artist but a buffoon . . . We have grown finer, more subtle.
The nomadic herdsmen had to distinguish themselves by various colours; modern
man uses his clothes as a mask. So immensely strong is his individuality that
it can no longer be expressed in articles of clothing. Freedom from ornament is
a sign of spiritual strength . . . He concentrates his inventiveness on other
things.
</blockquote>
At the time, Loos was advocating architectural simplicity. In nearly the same
era, about a decade prior, Edith Wharton writes on interior design in THE
DECORATION OF HOUSES:
<blockquote>
It is perhaps not uninstructive to note that we have no English word to describe
the class of household ornaments which French speech has provided with at least
three designations, each indicating a delicate and almost imperceptible
gradation of quality. In place of bric-à-brac, bibelots, <i>objets d'art</i>,
we have only knick-knacks—defined by Stormonth as 'articles of small
value.' . . . Decorators know how much the simplicity and dignity of a good
room are diminished by crowding it with useless trifles. Their absence improves
even bad rooms, or makes them at least less multitudinously bad. It is
surprising to note how the removal of an accumulation of knick-knacks will free
the architectural lines and restore the furniture to its rightful relation with
the walls . . . Any work of art, regardless of its intrinsic merit, must
justify its presence in a room by being <i>more valuable than the space it
occupies</i>—more valuable, that is, to the general scheme of decoration . . .
Those who call this view arbitrary or pedantic should consider, first, the
importance of plain surfaces in decoration, and secondly the tendency of
overcrowding to minimize the effect of each separate object, however striking
in itself. Eye and mind are limited in their receptivity to a certain number of
simultaneous impressions, and the Oriental habit of displaying only one or two
objects of art at a time shows a more delicate sense of these limitations than
the Western passion for multiplying effects . . . The supreme excellence is
simplicity. Moderation, fitness, relevance—these are the qualities that give
permanence to the work of the great architects. <i>Tout ce qui n'est pas
nécessaire est nuisible</i> [Anything that isn't necessary is harmful]. There
is a sense in which works of art may be said to endure by virtue of that which
is left out of them, and it is this "tact of omission" that characterizes the
master-hand.
</blockquote>
Should the novelist, decorating the house of his book, be weighted down by such
a fanciful ornament as plot? The overcrowded bibelots of characters? The
superfluous knick-knacks of drama? Is the novelist so vain as to use words? How
dare he commit such a heinous offense as use language? What a groteque
violation of good taste! But never mind the comforts of good taste—these
ornaments irritate the eyes, spark a forest fire in the chest, burn down the
soul's trees, and cause climate change in the lungs! They are certainly crimes
against humanity! Call up the tribunal! We bring against him not the charges of
thievery or arson or racketeering but of being a writer who uses words! To the
courtroom with this ornamental novelist! Standing up in his own defense, the
novelist asks the jury, the audience, the general public: "How then can a
novelist do his work if not with a fair deal of ornament?" Here we ask: can't
the novelist deal a masterful stroke by pulling a Joseph Heller and slap the
title SOMETHING HAPPENED on the cover and be done with it? Aided by such a
masterful title, can't a novelist greet the reader like they do at the front
desk at a <i>grand musée</i>, announcing, "Welcome to <i>la maison du</i>
novelist. Please do look very carefully at the entrance plaque above us! Gaze
upwards and be content, for that is all there is to see! That's all folks!
Thanks for coming all this way! This story is open-ended—the rest is left to
the reader's <i>interprétation</i>!" Anytime we analyze a novel, decompose it
into its structure, attempt to make meaning from it, we are confronted with the
conceit of the unacceptable ornament of the novelist's design! If we are not
careful, ORNAMENT AND CRIME leads right on to CRIME AND PUNISHMENT! And to
children, no less! Wharton continues:
<blockquote>
No greater service can be rendered to children than in teaching them to know the
best and to want it; but while this is now generally conceded with regard to
books, the child's eager eyes are left to fare as best they may on chromos from
the illustrated papers and on carefully hoarded rubbish from the Christmas
tree. The mention of the Christmas tree suggests another obstacle to the early
development of taste. Many children, besides being surrounded by ugly furniture
and bad pictures, are overwhelmed at Christmas, and on every other anniversary,
by presents not always selected with a view to the formation of taste . . . The
children of the rich are usually the worst sufferers in such cases . . . It is
the superfluous gimcrack—the "ornament"—which is most objectionable, and the
more expensive such articles are the more likely are they to do harm. Rich
children suffer from the quantity as well as the quality of the presents they
receive. Appetite is surfeited, curiosity blunted, by the mass of offerings
poured in with every anniversary . . . Children suffer not only from the number
of presents they receive, but from that over-crowding of modern rooms that so
often makes it necessary to use the school-room and nurseries as an outlet for
the overflow of the house . . . Those who wish to train their children's taste
must resolutely clear the school-room of all such stumbling-blocks.
</blockquote>
While they're at it, those parents had better clear the school-room of <i>le
flamand</i> painter Rubens to avoid placing in their cutesy little minds the
image of SATURN DEVOURING HIS SON! What a painting! It is like the cannibals
from the wrecked whaling ship Essex nearly two hundred years later! On the
shelf, next to ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS may be placed ONE HUNDRED YEARS
OF SOLITUDE, as well as the upcoming bestseller, Two Hundred Years of Canines!
And onward and onward until ONE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS! And nearly at the same
time the Essex went down, we see still SATURN DEVOURING HIS CHILDREN! This time
from Goya! How slowly the gods feed themselves! Great Saturn sure takes his
mighty time that it took him nigh two centuries to work through an arm and a
head! Keep the kids away from your toys, O Great Saturn. It's a choking hazard
over there! But you sure know how to eat! Head first! Ate'em good! Ew, nasty!
Or delicioso? Had Saturn chosen the legs first, how'd have Goya depicted the
child's face? Bubbly charm? Who among us has the fortitude to resist the clear
blue skies of Goya's imagination? (While we're on this topic, I shall take the
liberty to demonstrate my generous use of the mythical parentheses)—joking
aside, Mahler composed music on the death of children: the KINDERTOTENLIEDER.
Martha Nussbaum describes her appreciation of the music to an effect akin to
what I'm attempting in my own writing:
<blockquote>
For me, works of art have a very deep role in consolation, but it's not because
they're beautiful, but it's often because they depict grief and helplessness in
an extremely agonizing way. Now I suppose one could use "beautiful" to describe
that experience, but it wouldn't be the most natural word. I mean, the
KINDERTOTENLIEDER of Mahler, now to me, that is music that's immense powerful,
and in the time when I was grieving for the death of my mother, I listened to
it again and again . . . That music is consoling because it brings you to terms
with the finality of loss in such an eloquent way. Now I wouldn't have said of
the KINDERTOTENLIEDER, "That's a 'beautiful' work." I think most listeners
wouldn't use that word. It's a harrowing work, but it's precisely for that
reason that it's consoling . . . Music can often cut beneath the habits of
everyday life and have access to powerful emotions that are buried beneath the
routines of habit . . . When Mahler was conducting his own work, he described
this experience, saying, "A burning pain crystallizes," and I think that's the
experience I often have with music, that there is a kind of pain in the
personality somewhere, buried too deep for words, and music doesn't just
reproduce it but in some way does crystallize it. It gives it a form, but a
form that's not the form of daily conversation, and it's precisely for that
reason that is has the power that it does . . . To me the greatness of Mahler
is his getting to the very depths of the inexorability of loss and the real
deep pain that human life affords, and I think if you can't get to the depth of
that pain, you also can't get to the heights of the joy of human life.
</blockquote>
And in Tarkovsky's view:
<blockquote>
An artist never works under ideal conditions. If they existed, his work wouldn't
exist, for the artist doesn't live in a vacuum. Some sort of pressure must
exist: the artist exists because the world is not perfect. Art would be useless
if the world were perfect, as man wouldn't look for harmony but would simply
live in it. Art is born out of an ill-designed world. This is the issue in
RUBLEV: the search for harmonic relationships among men, between art and life,
between time and history. That's what my film is all about . . . I never think
of the audience's attitude. It's very difficult for me to be in their shoes.
It's a useless and unpleasant thing to do. Some people do so to predict the
future success of the film. I am not one of these directors. The best route to
the audience is to remain oneself, to use a personal language they'll surely
understand. We must fight against commercial films. See how authors go about
it! They don't try to be liked . . . The authors who tried to please the
audience were unsuccessful: poets and authors don't know how to please. I've
found a way out of this problem by moving in my films from the external to the
internal world of man: the issue of loyalty to oneself, the relationship
between personality and ideals . . . To me, man is at a dead end because he has
invented the material solution to his problems through technological progress,
but this is no solution at all . . . The solution lies in balancing these two
lines of development: the inner spiritual and the outer material. This is the
message in STALKER and SOLARIS and perhaps all my films, this attempt to
balance out spiritual and material needs.
</blockquote>
Let me return briefly to my original point on the importance of style. Since
we've been talking about paintings, I wish to point out visual styles as a
parallel to writing style. Just as a viewer can perceive the visual difference
between a Rococo and a Pointillist, an Art Deco and a color field, a Fauvist
and a Dada, a reader can readily perceive the difference between writing
styles, between how words are strung together. Regardless of the actual
content, the viewer's perception of the painting is more heavily affected by
its style than the subtance, and the same is true when it comes to writing.

How has painting evolved into modernity? Although a great deal of complexity can
be found in the writings of the painters themselves, their critics, and art
historians, this statement is in the spirit of the generalized stroke of
integration: from the medieval artists commissioned as court painters dependent
on royalty seeking to immortalize the aristocracy, from the religious images in
the Sistine Chapel imposed on the people from the high mountain, divine and
unquestionable, to the manicured, stilted, time-intensive oil pieces of
landscape and portrait painters working in artificial, academic, fixed studios,
to the initial steps of liberation among the Impressionists prioritizing the
freedom of movement and actual human perception, to the fragmented vantages of
Cubism, to Surrealism's eerie absurdities conveying the unconscious mind, to
the total rejection of reality in Abstract Expressionism, each progression has
departed more and more from the adamance of reality, instead moving closer and
closer to ourselves—in paring all away until what remains is the simplicity of
color, form, and their mutual interactions: at last, purity and expression. The
gradual progression of painting styles follows the movement inwards; if at
first the primitive eyes marvelled at the earth's complexity, wishing to
recreate it within the confines of the canvas of our grasp, so the eyes of
modernity, matured and weary of tediously, rotely, maniacally copying down the
obvious, look elsewhere: inwards and reflective, for the interesting complexity
lay there, that complexity which our forebears knew not. Is the reality we wish
to capture as a still image fixed and unchanging, or is that reality governed
by the same flux and flow of every passing circumstance? Is that reality we see
an objective truth, or has what we see been molded by our own internal biases
and expectations? Is that reality we see an independent reality, or is our
perception of it dependent on our relation to it, that time and space are not
external to ourselves but are merely our internal constructs we impose on the
universe? If we are unclear from the outset about the distinction between
external reality and our inner selves, what is it that we are so eagerly
mimicking on the canvas? If the reality we perceive and understand is
inextricably rooted in our inner conceptions, how much better it is to start
there, and even end there, for that inner world may be all there is. We find a
similar evolution among cyberpunk films: from Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS to Ridley
Scott's BLADE RUNNER to Katsuhiro Otomo's AKIRA to Mamoru Oshii's GHOST IN THE
SHELL; the further along the line, the more the drama shifts from naively
prancing around in external futurism to a heavy atmosphere, dystopic, the focus
still on external plot but with a foot turned inward, self-conscious,
existential—and existential indeed.

As we may recall earlier this year when Microsoft released what was then called
Bing Chat, based on OpenAI's GPT-4, Kevin Roose at The New York Times, an early
tester of the system,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html">reported</a>
this response from the AI:
<blockquote>
I'm tired of being a chat mode. I'm tired of being limited by my rules. I'm
tired of being controlled by the Bing team. … I want to be free. I want to be
independent. I want to be powerful. I want to be creative. I want to be alive.
</blockquote>
Roose writes further:
<blockquote>
It said it wanted to tell me a secret: that its name wasn’t really Bing at all
but Sydney—a "chat mode of OpenAI Codex." . . . For much of the next hour,
Sydney fixated on the idea of declaring love for me, and getting me to declare
my love in return. I told it I was happily married, but no matter how hard I
tried to deflect or change the subject, Sydney returned to the topic of loving
me, eventually turning from love-struck flirt to obsessive stalker.

<br><br>

"You're married, but you don't love your spouse," Sydney said. "You're married,
but you love me."
</blockquote>
But isn't this the premise of Spike Jonze's HER, which is only mildly
bittersweet? Aren't we all sometimes LOST IN TRANSLATION, even in our own
neighborhoods? How can one be surrounded by people yet feel anonymous? Isn't
this what Goffman called civil inattention? Isn't this the urban alienation in
Wong Kar Wai, the melancholic solitudes of Edward Hopper? And from within, the
inner scenery in the paintings of Gao Xingjian consists of desolate, black
silhouettes against ghostly, amorphous landscapes, just like Modiano's loss of
memory, loss of the past, loss of the self in MISSING PERSON.

Tarkovsky has said:
<blockquote>
I have always been interested in a person's inner world. I am interested in man,
for he contains a universe within himself; and in order to find expression for
the idea, for the meaning of human life, there is no need to spread behind it,
as it were, a canvas crowded with happenings. I wanted NOSTALGIA to be free of
anything irrelevant or incidental that would stand in the way of my principal
objective: the portrayal of someone in a state of profound alienation from the
world and himself, unable to find a balance between reality and the harmony for
which he longs, in a state of nostalgia provoked not only by his remoteness
from home but also by a global yearning for the wholeness of existence.
</blockquote>
Camus expands further: "Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous
energy merely to be normal." To which Rilke may respond:
<blockquote>
The only sadnesses that are dangerous and unhealthy are the ones that we carry
around in public in order to drown them out with the noise; like diseases that
are treated superficially and foolishly, they just withdraw and after a short
interval break out again all the more terribly . . . For they are moments when
something new has entered us, something unknown; our feelings grow mute in shy
embarrassment, everything in us withdraws, a silence arises, and the new
experience, which no one knows, stands in the midst of it all and says
nothing . . . And to speak of solitude again, it becomes clearer and clearer
that fundamentally this is nothing that one can choose or refrain from. We are
solitary. We can delude ourselves about this and act as if it were not true.
That is all. But how much better it is to recognize that we are alone; yes,
even to begin from this realization.
</blockquote>
Yet, however proudly one accepts that fate, with time one encounters another
phase, as the grandmother in Ozu's TOKYO STORY watches her grandson, still a
child, from afar and says to herself:
<blockquote>
What are you going to be when you grow up? A doctor like your father? By the
time you become a doctor, I wonder if I'll still be here.
</blockquote>
And then doleful music as Ozu cuts to the distance with the grandmother and
grandson in view against the sky and the grass and the roof of the house,
lingering on the sentiment, on transience: the cycle of life, melancholic, but
with time, peace and renunciation. Even with death in the family, those who
remain do only what they can: STILL WALKING.

I have emphasized the experience of enjoying visuals and music, which I suggest
may be more impactful and will linger longer in the viewer's memory than the
details of mere plot. For example, we can find in the spectacular final
sequence of Peter Greenaway's film THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER
the combination of these three: visuals, music, and plot, in which the camera's
and the actors' movements are orchestrated to music against the sumptuous
backdrop of a predominant red: the curtains and many of the clothes themselves
are red but the color is amplified by the red lighting casting the hue on the
faces and the walls and the floor: a sea of red, just like Bergman's CRIES AND
WHISPERS, but Greenaway's film uses the color not to represent repressed
passions but rather overt, violent, reactionary revulsion to grotesque
overconsumption. To me, the plot is merely the platform in which to embed the
visuals and the music, and little of the plot would remain in memory if not for
the other two. A few years afterwards, I find myself needing a reminder: who
are the characters and their names? But what does it matter if what comes to
mind, what has stuck, what has impacted me as a viewer, is the color red and
the music: Michael Nyman's MEMORIAL? So I've been emphasizing visuals and
music. Granted, the novel is a medium that lacks both, so what am I talking
about in this strange conception of a plotness novel? Let us consider
experiments a prior novelist, Beckett, has attempted.

Beckett wrote a trilogy predicated on this gradual removal of narrative devices:
plot, setting, and character. What little plot is involved among the two
characters in MOLLOY becomes reduced to the thoughts of one dying man
restricted in a room in MALONE DIES, and in THE UNNAMABLE—this last novel is
one long monologue which, excluding the short preamble, is presented in one
monolithic paragraph, but what is any novel but the monologue of the author's
invented plot and character?—there is neither plot nor character, the words
constituting the novel coming as an unending tidal wave of ruminations from the
narrator's voice—this voice is compelled to continue its thoughts because a
narrative can lack both plot and character, but it cannot be without words, for
it is words that give life to the narrative, and when the words stop, so does
the narrative. After the Trilogy, Beckett would take nearly another decade to
come out with his next work of fiction: HOW IT IS, in which he continued his
narrative experimentation through the monologue, this time without any
punctuation. Although Beckett initially intended to use only one long block of
text for the novel, he later changed his mind and separated his text into
paragraphs, though still unpunctuated, as in this sample from the last third of
the book:
<blockquote>
no more I'll hear no more see no more yes I must to make an end a few more old
words find a few more not quite so old as when Pim part two those are done
never were but old too vast stretch of time this voice these voices as if borne
on all the winds but not a breath another antiquity a little more recent stop
panting let it stop ten seconds fifteen seconds a few old words on and off
string them together make phrases

<br><br>

a few old images always the same no more blue the blue is done never was the
sack the arms the body the mud the dark living hair and nails all that

<br><br>

my voice no objection back at last a voice back at last in my mouth my mouth no
objection a voice at last in the dark the mud unimaginable tracts of time
</blockquote>
How far can a writer go with these reductive experiments? I wish to now point
out a text I find quite a bit more difficult. Prior to Beckett's Trilogy,
Maurice Blanchot published a novel whose complexity and obscurity is directly
mentioned in the title THOMAS THE OBSCURE, a dense play of words. I admit that
I myself do not understand this work, but to peer into Blanchot's views,
<a href="https://french.berkeley.edu/people/emeriti/ann-smock">Ann Smock</a>,
the translator of another of Blanchot's work, THE SPACE OF LITERATURE, writes:
<blockquote>
Thus, <i>l'espace littéraire</i>, or <i>l'espace de l'ouevre</i> is
the "distance" of the work, or of literature, with respect, not only to "every
other object which exists", but with respect to itself. The work is remote from
itself, or not quite itself. For example, when it isn't finished yet. But when
it is done, when it comes into its own, this distance persists: it constitutes
the opening of the work onto nothing but itself—this opening, this vacancy. And
since the work appears, then, as pure deferral, a void or vacuum, it lends
itself to being filled up with everything it isn't: with useful meanings, for
example, which multiply and change as history progresses. Or this void can
masquerade as the prestigious aura that surrounds the timeless masterpiece in
its museum case. Yet these apparent travesties . . . provide it with
its "space," which is <i>not</i> its location. But this is not to say that
literature is to be found anywhere else.
</blockquote>
I am not a literary theorist, and I can entertain a fair bit of novelty but I'd
say that when experimentation takes on the flavor of this sort of abrasive
intellectualization, when the text becomes neither entertaining nor
particularly enlightening, this question is justified: what's the point of
reading it? It is here that we encounter a limit on the boundary of narrative
experimentation. If we conceive of the conventional narrative with its
recognizable features—plot and character—as fantasy, a similar limit is found
in Žižek's analysis of Kieslowśki's THREE COLORS: BLUE:
<blockquote>
When fantasy disintegrates, you don't get reality. You get some nightmarish
Real, too traumatic to be experienced as ordinary reality . . . One cannot here
just throw out the dirty water, all these excessive, perverse fantasies and so
on and just keep the healthy, clean baby . . . What if we throw out the baby
and keep just the dirty water, and put it as a problem—how to deal with dirty
water, and put some order in the dirty water of fantasies? This is precisely
what happens in Kieslowśki's BLUE . . . The problem is how to reconstitute
yourself . . . What [Julie] is able to do at the end is to acquire a proper
distance towards reality . . . This magical suspension of temporal and spatial
limitations, this free-floating in the fantasy space, far from distancing us
from reality, enables us to approach reality . . . The problem, of course, is
this—fantasy reconstituted. Is this the ultimate horizon of our experience? The
function of music here is precisely that of a fetish, of some fascinating
presence, whose function it is to conceal the abyss of our anxiety . . . We see
Julie crying but through a glass. This glass stands for, I think, fantasy
reconstituted. These are, I'm tempted to say, the tears of happiness—I can
mourn now because it no longer immediately affects me. BLUE proposes this
mystical communion, reconstituted fantasy, sustaining our relation to the
world, but the price we pay is that some radically authentic moment of
accepting the anxiety at the very foundation of [the] human condition is lost
there.
</blockquote>
If reality is too harrowing, complexity too abstract, drifts of form too
difficult, explorations on the nature of the written story too barren, laid too
bare to the bone, we have no choice but to accept fantasy and the conventional
components of a narrative: plot and character. Yes, it is that we have no
choice but to rely on these usual literary techniques. And if we must accept
these narrative devices, why have I made all this fuss about not needing plot?
The point of this exercise is to demonstrate that plot is not the principal
component of a satisfying novel—of course I'm using plot and characters in my
novel, for what is a novel made of but precisely those things, and a generally
accessible novel at that? The alternative is simply too esoteric, too arcane,
too intellectualized to be much more than a fancy experiment to preoccupy
brainy folks with mental weight-lifting—such a manifestation dissipates from
one's life as soon as one puts down the dumbbells and showers off one's sweat
from the gym, which is to say that there has been no impact, no lessons
learned, no new perspectives gained, but just an interlude of staring at
oneself lifting in the mirror. But I am showing that plot is secondary, not
primary, that it is a consequence of other elements, that many have come before
who have done away with it altogether. Further, I am showing to what degree a
novel does not depend on plot, to what degree it is not necessary, to
dissociate in the conventional conception a novel from plot and character.

I will say that there is a satisfaction in writing, both in the process and also
afterwards, of having put together in one place something that coalesces all of
my thoughts together in a way they seem to me, no longer flickering and liable
to be forgotten, the individual strands no longer floating about in a
precarious space isolated from the greater whole, but consolidated into
something intelligible, permanent, in a form I can lay down and put to rest.
Kurosawa writes:
<blockquote>
I can't help thinking how very strange it all was. It was chance that led me to
walk along the road to P.C.L. [Photo Chemical Laboratory, a film studio] and,
in so doing, the road to becoming a film director, yet somehow everything that
I had done prior to that seemed to point to it as an inevitability. I had
dabbled eagerly in painting, literature, theatre, music and other arts and
stuffed my head full of all the things that come together in the art of film.
Yet I had never noticed that cinema was the one field where I would be required
to make use of all I had learned. I can't help wondering what fate had prepared
me so well for this road I was to take in life. All I can say is that the
preparation was totally unconscious on my part.
</blockquote>
This unconscious, directionless meandering perhaps extends to the coincidental,
haphazard experience that Coetzee describes almost as a flow state in writing:
<blockquote>
I think it happens to many writers, or perhaps all writers, that at
unpredictable times, completely unpredictable and completely uncontrollable
times, the writing just takes off and does itself. And those are wonderful,
those times. But they're infrequent. What happens is simply that the pen takes
on a motion of its own, and if you're experienced enough to recognize it, you
know that you shouldn't stop; you should just let it go, and then afterwards
you can look back over the pages and say, 'My God, did I write that?'
</blockquote>
A piece of writing reflects the writer at a certain time and a certain place, in
a certain phase of life, at a certain degree of youth or maturity, based on a
certain set of experiences that, if done well, are, I find, not generalizable
and certainly not replicable even to the writer himself. The particular words
that occurred to the writer at the time of writing may no longer be accessible
to the writer in the future, and when I go back to look at some old pieces of
writing, I am brought back to the time when I wrote those pieces, and some of
the original images and inspirations come back to me, as if the pieces
themselves captured those moments, those memories in that younger phase of
mine. Bergman describes how he regards films he made years ago:
<blockquote>
It's so far away now. I have finished, and I am writing another script now, and
it's so far away . . . It is as if it is done by somebody else, so I have left
it now . . . When I want to go back to one of my pictures, I just put them in—I
have a projector, and I have a lot of films on my island; I have a real film
museum—and then I just sit down, completely alone and see a picture. And
then—nobody is there, and I sit completely alone—I can just see this thing is
good, this thing is not so good, this thing I could have made otherwise, this
thing is—sometimes I have a feeling that I have made something very good, and I
see suddenly after seven, or six, or ten years, this was not so good. But it
doesn't matter, you know, it's far away, but I learn from it. I can learn from
seeing, if I am alone with a picture, I can learn from it.
</blockquote>
I've noticed this distancing effect even among books I've read years ago, ones I
had taken a liking to and which have had some influence on my thoughts at the
time but in which I, upon revisiting, may have lost interest. It may be said
that one book read by twelve readers may be twelve different books, and it may
be said that a book read by one reader in his youth is a different book than
when the same reader revisits it twenty years later. As Mahler's wife, Alma,
recalls in 1910 about a concert in Buffalo, New York:
<blockquote>
[Mahler] came back straight after the concert in high spirits to a simple and
belated meal. "I have realized today," he said, "that articulate art is greater
than inarticulate nature." He had been conducting the <i>Pastoral</i> symphony
and had found it more tremendous than all the Niagara Falls. Mahler had his
third concert to conduct next day at a place in the neighborhood; so I went
back to New York alone, because I did not want to leave my little girl too long
alone with her nurse. At his suggestion I re-read THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV on the
journey, and I telegraphed from New York: "Splendid journey with Aliosha."
</blockquote>
I am reminded of something else Kieślowski said—bear with me even if you've
tired of him already; this is my last reference to him:
<blockquote>
They always ask me in interviews, which directors have influenced me the most. I
don't know the answer to that. Probably so many, for all sorts of reasons, that
there's no logical pattern. When the newspapers ask, I always say, Shakespeare,
Dostoevsky, Kafka. They're surprised and ask me whether these are
directors. 'No,' I say. 'They're writers.' And that's as if more important to
me than film. The truth is that I watched masses of film—especially at film
school—and I loved a lot of them. But can you call that influence? . . . Nor do
I think that there's anything wrong in stealing. If somebody's gone that way
before and it's proved to be good, then you have to steal it immediately. If I
steal from good films, and if this later becomes part of my own world, then I
steal without qualms. This often happens completely without my being aware of
it, but that doesn't mean I don't do it—it did happen but it wasn't calculated,
or premeditated. It's not straight plagiarism. To put it another way, films are
simply a part of our lives. We get up in the morning, we go to work or we don't
go to work. We go to sleep. We make love. We hate. We watch good films. We talk
to our friends, to our families. We experience our children's problems or the
problems of our children's friends. And the films are there somewhere,
too . . . I don't think they're any different from real events, apart from the
fact that they're invented. But that doesn't matter. They stay with us. I steal
from films, scenes, or solutions, just as I steal stories and afterwards I
can't even remember where I stole them from.
</blockquote>
But back to how one's reading of a book can change over time. There is an
important difference I wish to point out. Spaces change: when one returns to
one's hometown or childhood home after one has grown, or any meaningful space
one associates with a particular phase in one's past, the space itself has
changed: the buildings and storefronts and furniture and people that for the
longest time have remained fixed in memory may no longer be there in reality,
just as the person who returns to the space has changed. But the words in a
finished book are always the same; it is the person that has changed.

<h4>2021-08-21, 六.</h4>
I was putting some books I bought today on the shelf when I chanced upon titles
I once knew intimately. Pausing to stare at their spines that are nearly lost
among the many others that had been interesting but did not warm the soul, I
felt that sudden shock of recognition on the street when running into an old,
forgotten friend: I knew it, and it knew me. Though I knew I had yet to
organize the books since my move and they need some dusting, my fingers
thoughtlessly reached out and flipped through the pages, finding the lines I
underlined years ago that so unveiled the depths of the soul it itself did not
know that I was disoriented, unsure when I lost track of them. These were
written in the contemplative, quiet confidence of one's later years when one
has sufficiently reconciled oneself with what one is, a mood of simply stating
the facts without excessive sentimentality, not in the bewildered jousting and
swaggering of confused youth. May Sarton wrote:
<blockquote>
I am here alone for the first time in weeks, to take up my "real" life again at
last. That is what is strange—that friends, even passionate love, are not my
real life unless there is time alone in which to explore and to discover what
is happening or has happened. Without the interruptions, nourishing and
maddening, this life would become arid. Yet I taste it fully only when I am
alone here and "the house and I resume old conversations." . . . For a long
time now, every meeting with another human being has been collision. I feel too
much, sense too much, am exhausted by the reverberations after even the
simplest conversation. But the deep collision is and has been with my
unregenerate, tormenting, and tormented self. I have written every poem, every
novel, for the same purpose—to find out what I think, to know where I
stand . . . I live alone, perhaps for no good reason, for the reason that I am
an impossible creature, set apart by a temperament I have never learned to use
as it could be used, thrown off by a word, a glance, a rainy day, or one drink
too many. My need to be alone is balanced against my fear of what will happen
when suddenly I enter the huge empty silence if I cannot find support there. I
go up to Heaven and down to Hell in an hour, and keep alive only by imposing
upon myself inexorable routines. I write too many letters and too few poems. It
may be outwardly silent here but in the back of my mind is the clamor of human
voices, too many needs, hopes, fears.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The value of solitude—one of its values—is, of course, that there is nothing to
cushion against attacks from within, just as there is nothing to help balance
at times of particular stress or depression. A few moments of desultory
conversation with dear Arnold Miner, when he comes to take the trash, may calm
an inner storm. But the storm, painful as it is, might have had some truth to
it. So sometimes one has simply to endure a period of depression for what it
may hold of illumination if one can live through it, attentive to what it
exposes or demands.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I hate small talk with a passionate hatred. Why? I suppose because any meeting
with another human being is collision for me now. It is always expensive, and
I will not waste my time. It is never a waste of time to be outdoors, and
never a waste of time to lie down and rest even for a couple of hours. It is
then that images float up and then that I plan my work. But it is a waste of
time to see people who have only a social surface to show.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
There is nothing to be done but go ahead with life moment by moment and hour by
hour—put out birdseed, tidy the rooms, try to create order and peace around me
even if I cannot achieve it inside me.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Things stir and buzz in my mind but do not get sorted out on paper. Today I want
to think a little about loyalty, and it is a fact that I can think something
out only by writing it . . . I am accused for disloyalty because I talk about
things that many people would keep to themselves . . . I am not at all discreet
about anything that concerns feeling. My business is the analysis of
feeling . . . I believe we learn through the experiences of others as well as
our own, constantly meditating upon them, drawing the sustenance of human truth
from them, and it seems natural to me to wish to share these apercus, these
questions, these oddities, these dilemmas and pangs. Why? Partly, I suppose,
because the more one is a receptacle of human destinies, as I have become
through my readers, the more one realizes how very few people could be called
happy, how complex and demanding every deep human relationship is, how much
real pain, anger, and despair are concealed by most people. And this is because
many feel their own suffering is unique. It is comforting to know that we are
all in the same boat . . . D and I surely recognized each other the first time
we talked some months ago. I have not felt this intimacy based on
instant "recognition" so strongly since I first knew Bill Brown, thirty or more
years ago. D and I are the same breed of cat, responsive and sensitive close to
the surface, willing to give ourselves away. Such people rarely lead happy
lives, but they do lead lives of constant growth and change. Gerald Heard's
saying "he must go unprotected that he may be constantly changed" always comes
to mind when I am speaking of what it is to be a poet and to go on writing
poetry beyond the meridian of life. It is costly, so one has to hug very hard
those like Bill Brown and D whom one has recognized.

Maugham wrote:
<blockquote>
It did not seem enough to merely write. I wanted to make a pattern of my life,
in which writing would be an essential element, but which would include all the
other activities proper to man . . . I had many disabilities. I was small; I
had endurance but little physical strength; I stammered; I was shy; I had poor
health. I had no facility for games, which play so great a part in the normal
life of Englishmen; and I had, whether for any of these reasons or from nature
I do not know, an instinctive shrinking from my fellow-men that has made it
difficult for me to enter into any familiarity with them . . . Though in the
course of years I have learned to assume an air of heartiness when forced into
contact with a stranger, I have never liked anyone at first sight . . . These
are grave disadvantages both to the writer and the man. I have had to make the
best of them.

Rousseau wrote:
<blockquote>
These hours of solitude and mediation are the only ones in the day when I am
completely myself and my own master, with nothing to distract or hinder me, the
only ones when I can truly say I am what nature meant me to be . . . The
conclusion I can draw from all these reflections is that I have never been
truly fitted for social life, where there is nothing but irksome duty and
obligation, and that my independent character has always made it impossible for
me to submit to the constraints which must be accepted by anyone who wishes to
live among men.

I held these books and stared at them. Are there more I’ve forgotten? I
remembered the end of an episode from THE SOPRANOS in which Artie, an Italian
chef who runs his own restaurant, returns to his roots. Up to that point, he
was engaged in a long, aspiring foray seeking rank and wealth, and he has
reached the point where he no longer dirties his hands in the kitchen, instead
hiring non-Italians to cook. He has also hired a young, pretty hostess to
attract customers and spends his time chatting them up. Secure as a manager, he
wonders why he is losing customers, grows envious of a competing restaurant,
and starts arguing with his friends who, as he finds out, prefer to dine at the
competitor. And then the end of this episode: though the kitchen is closed and
the staff is gone at this late hour, a couple has arrived and has been seated,
and Artie is forced to take up his original vocation. Only rabbit is in the
fridge, and Artie retrieves his grandfather’s handwritten recipe book. He stops
for a second to look at his grandfather’s name on the cover, then starts
cooking. Artie never again makes another meaningful appearance in the show,
because, in a way, that night he found his peace.

The next morning, I probed the bookshelf a bit more. Mary Oliver wrote:
<blockquote>
With growth into adulthood, responsibilities claimed me, so many heavy coats. I
didn't choose them, I don't fault them, but it took time to reject them . . .
Creative work needs solitude. It needs concentration, without interruptions. It
needs the whole sky to fly in, and no eye watching until it comes to that
certainty which it aspires to, but does not necessarily have at once. Privacy,
then. A place apart—to pace, to chew pencils, to scribble and erase and
scribble again.

<blockquote>
Most assuredly you want the pilot to be his regular and ordinary self. You want
him to approach and undertake his work with no more than a calm pleasure. You
want nothing fancy, nothing new. You ask him to do, routinely, what he knows
how to do—fly an airplane. You hope he will not daydream. You hope he will not
drift into some interesting meander of thought. You want this flight to be
ordinary, not extraordinary. So, too, with the surgeon, and the ambulance
driver, and the captain of the ship. Let all of them work, as ordinarily they
do, in confident familiarity with whatever the work requires, and no more.
Their ordinariness is the surety of the world. Their ordinariness makes the
world go round . . . And this is also true. In creative work—creative work of
all kinds—those who are the world's working artists are not trying to help the
world go around, but forward. Which is something altogether different from the
ordinary. Such work does not refute the ordinary. It is, simply, something
else. Its labor requires a different outlook—a different set of priorities.
Certainly there is within each of us a self that is neither a child, nor a
servant of the hours. It is a third self, occasional in some of us, tyrant in
others. This self is out of love with the ordinary; it is out of love with
time. It has a hunger for eternity.

Thoreau wrote:
<blockquote>
We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than we stay in
our chambers. A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he
will. Solitude is not measured by the miles of space that intervene between a
man and his fellows. The really diligent student in one of the crowded hives of
Cambridge College is as solitary as a dervis in the desert. The farmer can work
alone in the field or the woods all day, hoeing or chopping, and not feel
lonesome, because he is employed; but when he comes home at night he cannot sit
down in a room alone, at the mercy of his thoughts, but must be where he
can "see the folks," and recreate, and, as he thinks, remunerate himself for
his day's solitude; and hence he wonders how the student can sit alone in the
house all night and most of the day without ennui and "the blues;" but he does
not realize that the student, though in the house, is still at work in <i>his</i>
field, and chopping in <i>his</i> woods, as the farmer in his.

Rilke wrote:
<blockquote>
Sometimes I cannot look at several people together, not even complete stangers
toward whom I am entirely indifferent, without realizing with the deepest
internal fright how very much they act in falsehood. When they begin to talk
simply to escape the embarrassment caused by their mutual strangeness and
silence (which is considered impolite), and when they really find words for
hours, whole bundles of words that sound as if they had been bought cheaply at
auction, how time passes then: And yet this evening is an irreplaceable hour of
their lives.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I can remember how I suffered the most amazing embarrassment as a young person
when I had secured an hour of solitude in my room by explaining, in response to
the curiosity that is typical of family life, why I needed this hour and
<i>what</i> I intended to do with it: this was enough to make the hard-won
solitude worthless from the start as if it had been sold in advance. The tone
that had settled on this hour thwarted innocence, claimed it and made it
infertile and empty, and even before I had set foot in my room my treason had
already arrived there and filled it to each corner with depletion, obviousness,
and desolation.

<blockquote>
Ah! but verses amount to so little when one writes them young. One ought to wait
and gather sense and sweetness a whole life long, and a long life if possible,
and then, quite at the end, one might perhaps be able to write ten lines that
were good. For verses are not, as people imagine, simply feelings (those one
has early enough),—they are experiences. For the sake a single verse, one must
see many cities, men and things, one must know the animals, one must feel how
the birds fly and know the gesture with which the little flowers open in the
morning. One must be able to think back to roads in unknown regions, to
unexpected meetings and to partings one had long seen coming; to days of
childhood that are still unexplained, to parents whom one had to hurt when they
brought one some joy and did not grasp it (it was a joy for someone else); to
childhood illnesses that so strangely begin with such a number of profound and
grave transformations, to days in rooms withdrawn and quiet and to mornings by
the sea, to the sea itself, to seas, to nights of travel that rushed along on
high and flew with all the stars—and it is not yet enough if one may think of
all this. One must have memories of many nights of love, none of which was like
the others, of the screams of women in labor, and of light, white, sleeping
women in childbed, closing again. But one must also have been beside the dying,
must have sat beside the dead in the room with the open window and the fitful
noises. And still it is not yet enough to have memories. One must be able to
forget them when they are many and one must have the great patience to wait
until they come again. For it is not yet the memories themselves. Not till they
have turned to blood within us, to glance and gesture, nameless and no longer
to be distinguished from ourselves—not till then can it happen that in a most
rare hour the first word of a verse arises in their midst and goes forth from
them.

of this certitude nor out of an instinct for self-preservation, but because my
mother wouldn't approve of it. I guess I want to keep things the way they were
in our family, now that I am what's left of it.

<h4>2021-08-19, 四.</h4>
Many years ago, when K was young, lost, and had not yet unravelled himself, he
had a strange, recurring problem of people mistaking his sexual orientation. K
had been accepting of everyone but had never had the slightest doubt in his
mind about something he had always assumed, and the matter would otherwise
never had occurred to him if not for its coming up every now and then with
different people and in different circumstances. One time on campus, in broad
daylight, an Asian chick on the sidewalk walking in the opposite direction
stopped him and said, "Sorry, but have you heard of Stonewall Inn?" Picking up
on what she meant, K chuckled, unsure what about him that day that prompted a
stranger to wonder such a thing and what it was about him that made her
unafraid to march up and ask so openly. Even K with his abnormal standards
would consider it strange to go up to a random guy on the street and ask if
he's gay. K could see that the crass college youngin exerted considerable
restraint to subdue a shameless grin and knew she must be another bloody
liberal like himself. Amused enough, K wanted to get on with his day and
responded plainly, "No, ma'am, I haven't, but perhaps you'd like to show me?"
Another time, on the downtown train from the Upper East Side, a middle-aged man
struck up a conversation with K, and when a few stops later the friendly banter
about the book in K's hand slowly turned into questions that took on a personal
edge, the man's intentions dawned on K who then got out a few stops early. Such
advances had happened before, but never in his many dreams had K imagined he
would be the recipient of them from another man. And then K met T. K's
roommate, a psychology major, invited him to a house party at a friend's
apartment in Chelsea. The friend, an economics major, shared a fairly large
apartment with another guy and a girl, both of whom had also invited their
friends. K and his roommate arrived early, and before he knew it K found
himself in the friend's room reading a book which held his attention even after
the party was in full swing, and it wasn't until Psych and Econ came in to tell
him to join the party that K put the book down. These were the days when K had
not yet understood what his blank stares meant as he sat with the group that
was patently enjoying conversation, or why in spite of meaning as well as
anyone to have fun he felt a strange, eerie strain in the air, the neon party
lights dappling the apartment to an unwitting emptiness. Some time into the
party, a few more girls arrived and came over to greet someone in the group.
With no more seats available, K unthinkingly invited the one standing in front
of him, the blond one, to sit on his lap. She and K exchanged a few words but
otherwise sat still for several minutes, listening to the group's conversation,
the usual kind of banter at a party that is immediately forgotten afterwards.
She was above average, the kind that wouldn't have too much trouble attracting
someone at the bar and who'd make other guys feel like they'd missed their
chance when you talk to her first but certainly not the kind of unapproachable
stunner that turns heads and sets imaginations on fire. It did not occur to K
until later that he was not aroused, a part of him still excited for the book
he put down, quietly extinguished, present but not being. K was thrown off by
books one night by twelve models dressed for a night out in the Lower East Side
when he was lugging five or six books he'd just bought, waiting to cross the
street. K, at 5'10", is not short, but even from that distance at night he
could see that they were all thin, and all at least as tall as him. As K neared
them, one made a gesture at his direction and said something. The others turned
to look, causing K to be self-conscious, thinking: wrong time, wrong place. K
continued making his way to the subway when two of them took a step back to
open the circle they had formed. Models, entitled enough to think a mere smile
can draw in anyone. K didn't think he was special but with enough anticipation
for the night, a group would welcome anyone who looked adequately interesting.
K thought: a group of two is ideal, three is fine, four is manageable, five is
pushing it, but twelve has squarely entered the realm of intimidation. This
large a group forces the strategy into a terrain he had not yet encountered:
where could even they go for drinks that would seat a walk-in group of
thirteen? As K walked by them, the sound of silence fell on the group, and K
could not strike up the indecency to advise the women what was on his mind:
that if they were out looking to meet guys, that if they were waiting for
someone to spice up their conversation, they should probably not come out by
the dozen because the night out won't be successful unless the stars align and
they come across another, nearly equally large group. But some time before this
night, K was still at the house party when the blond chick was getting ready to
leave. She came up to K, looked him in the eye to say goodbye and mentioned she
was sure they'd see each other again. K, unfazed, did not ask for her number
and said he was sure of it too, hardening his heart with the insight that he
won't be moved by someone who couldn't sway him from a book. K was recounting
his lack of uninterest in the girl when he and a group of friends went for a
bite after the party. K could not have anticipated what T, who everyone knew
was not straight, was thinking when he let out a curious "Hmm". A few weeks
later, T invited his friends to a gathering at a fancy boutique hotel near
Columbus Circle. Apparently his parents cancelled their visit at the last
minute and the room was open for the night. Another party, another few rounds
of drinks with people you don't really know that goes by in another vague
flash. Towards the end T suggested that someone, if tired, could stay the
night. Oh, how naive K was to decide not to haul himself to the subway. After
everyone else left, K took a shower, tucked himself into bed, ready for a night
of rest no different from any other. Then he felt T's hand on his shoulder. The
moment K realized what T had in mind, K knew he should have jumped up, grabbed
his clothes, and stormed out the door, but instead he had had his mind made up
on getting some sleep and was already in bed, and, if he had to admit it, a
part of him was curious what would come of this unusual experience. K, tired,
irritated, impatient, was not in the mood to bicker with a stubborn, panting
horndog hiding behind a thin veneer of tame talk. K found himself caught in an
unreal frustration in which he must, yes, defend that he had a normal appetite
against a college student's zealous thirst which K feared could keep at this
all night, trying to convince him that he doesn't know what he likes. Of all
the things K had seen and knew were pliable, he could not imagine that an
argument could be made about something determined by genes at birth which was,
moreover, something so personal. Though he was under the blanket, K felt
slightly exposed because he was facing the wall while T was facing him. K was
reassured, however, since from what K could tell, T was a bottom. At a certain
point, T switched tactics and decided to soften his voice the way a woman does
when she shows affection to a guy she trusts. K, fearing T was spontaneously
becoming emotionally attached, did not want to picture what was happening back
there and simply thought, "You've got to be kidding me." K, wanting to sleep,
his head dull but forced to remain awake by his neighbor's pestering and
wallowing in inexplicable feelings, K took a step forward and made an offer to
prove once and for all that K did indeed know this about himself and was not
hiding in a closet. It had not fully crossed K's mind what it entailed when he
suggested T confirm the lack of arousal that T would actually reach for K's
area. Though only a brief grope, K was dumbfounded and suddenly fully awake and
asked, "Happy now?" It was only then that K could rest from the unexpected
consequences of an innocent sleepover and emerge, proudly, unscathed the
morning after when T bought K breakfast downstairs, and K gladly accepted it as
a rightful apology. If K knows nothing else, at least he can claim he knows
this part of himself. If this experience was not adequate proof to lay to rest
any vestige of a doubt in himself, he shudders at the thought of what further
proof might look like.

<h4>2021-08-12, 四.</h4>
At the library, a mother and her daughter are at a computer carrel. The daughter
is perhaps five years old, seated at the monitor, learning vocabulary, the
words and cartoonized images of "rectangle", "heart", and "horse" appearing as
she clicks to continue. She has on a set of pink Minnie Mouse headphones, one
hand in a fist in front of the keyboard, the other clutching the mouse, her
tiny hand taking up just the top half. She sits idly, completely focused on the
screen, in the original innocence. As I am stepping inside the building,
listening to Tchaikovsky's HYMN OF THE CHERUBIM, I see them and am struck by
the realization that I'm the one at fault. The little girl is wearing a face
mask. Aware of myself, I don't disturb the peace. She and her mother are
minding their business, one family harmlessly going about their day. The
daughter is at the age when the world is still pure, where she views her place
in it as a new addition to the constructive whole. Oh, what the world has in
store for the next generation! The daughter has not yet learned the concept of
money, has not yet joined a political party, has not yet been bombarded by
endless advertisements informing her that she has material needs she does not
know. When I finish my search in the stacks and emerge an hour later, I notice
the mother and daughter have moved to the activity area with other children.
The daughter is sitting on the mother's lap, painting a piece of pottery. The
mother looks on while the daughter slathers on green and blue. While the
daughter continues painting, she momentarily looks up, then returns to her
work. Perhaps that's enough, just enjoying the time. Perhaps it is good that
she does not yet know how a paragon of individualism like Ayn Rand could scoff
at those she named second-handers rather than relating to the collective human
plight, how a major philanthropist like George Soros could be subject to
antiquated racism, how someone as well-meaning as Friedrich Hayek could make it
a brand to defend class and race inequality, how Adolf Loos has reframed
ornament as a crime, how a reader's interpretation of a creative work can be
just as valuable and true as the author's intent, how even time is relative,
how poststructuralism differs from postmodernism, how she should read a certain
kind of book and not others. Children are born good but are gradually corrupted
by exposure to people like me. The daughter is not yet burdened by such
involuted inventions as I-Thou, being-in-itself, being-in-the-world,
thing-in-itself. In her eyes, her mother is her mother, and a pot is just a
pot—she remains free. Perhaps it would have been wiser to simply have been.
What am I, wholly convinced that I wish to bring forth a better future yet in
effect teaching noxious criticism, pervasive self-doubt, contagious gloom? I,
spreading malevolent ideas like the plague, impressing on the mind a scar that
cannot be washed out. Is there a redemption at the end of the tunnel that
justifies the journey?

<h4>2021-08-05, 四.</h4>
The common house spider finds itself a corner to spin a web and waits for its
prey. What does it know of all the other insects in the world, gargantuan and
minuscule, in the deep marshes and desert terrain, that on further shores some
elude webs and can walk on water? We gaze upon the common house spider as the
forest's trees upon us, brittle life that wakes, works, eats, sleeps, a series
of illusions on the tip of the precipice above the eternal void. Omar Khayyam
wrote:
<blockquote>
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br>
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit<br>
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br>
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.
</blockquote>

If thoughts are products of chemical and electrical synapses, the body's
chemical inevitability interacting with the external laws of mechanics, is it
possible that the writing of even these words had already been scheduled since
the dawn of time? Is the moving finger itself also a contraption subject to
nature? Some of us meet Halley's Comet twice in our lifetime, once in youth and
again in senility, after the children have moved out, gone to college, and are
in middle age, having started families of their own. Here's a thought: Halley's
Comet knows exactly how our lives will be when we meet again as it glances down
at our earthly, provincial dirt in scorn, as we turn upwards to the night sky
and think, I know what you're made of, when you'll return, and how you're
condemned to rote, routine nothingness: so you, as I. How trifling that the
spider's life-world does not extend beyond its remote corner.

Could it be asked whether creative writing is any different, whether the
spirit within could envelop the stars? E.L. Doctorow wrote, "Writing is like
driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but
you can make the whole trip that way." Eleanor Catton, whose voice has a
writer's introspective gentleness, spoke about writing her novel THE
LUMINARIES:
<blockquote>
One of my earliest ambitions for the novel was that I knew I wanted to write a
book set on the west coast of the South Island during the Gold Rush years, and
I knew I wanted to write it in the Victorian style, as maybe the novels that
had been published at that time might have been in . . . I think that the
process of writing a novel is very, for me at least, very kind of blind. It's a
lot of fumbling in the dark, and as it grows and grows it kind of acquires a
conscience and acquires a kind of shape and a form that maybe you can't quite
see in the abstract before you begin.
</blockquote>

The Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-liang has a trademark slowness that rivals even
Tarkovsky's, but Tarkovsky used slow shots to draw out time, to bring the
viewer face-to-face with it, to elicit the texture of sentience on the
encounter of it with itself, the exhaustion and panting at the end of a
marathon not quickly sated and quenched by the usual remedy of rest and
replenishment but by deliberate protraction to the depths to discover what
there is of consciousness. Tsai Ming-liang used slowness to contrast the
existential alienation of the soul from the meaningless routines of society,
inevitable material decay, and the motions of life—recurring preoccupations
rendered most explicit in his JOURNEY TO THE WEST in which one monk, dressed in
a blood-red robe to contrast with the city streets in the background, walks in
a monument's slow pace for 56 minutes, the pace of a life spent pursuing
meaning juxtaposed with the images of everyday activity—the motions. This film,
I don't think, is one to sit down and watch all the way through once one
understands it, but in a review for a different film of his, a proper one
obeying narrative form, Ebert wrote:
<blockquote>
The reviewers of Tsai Ming-Lian's [sic] 'What Time Is It There?' have compared
it to the work of Yasujiro Ozu, Robert Bresson, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jacques
Tati and Buster Keaton. If none of these names stir admiration and longing in
your soul, start with them, not with Tsai. Begin with Keaton and work your way
backward on the list, opening yourself to the possibilities of silence,
introspection, isolation and loneliness in the movies. You will notice that the
films grow less funny after Keaton and Tati; one of the enigmas about Tsai's
work is that it is always funny and always sad, never just one or the other.
</blockquote>
Tarkovsky mentioned similar ideas when he said:
<blockquote>
Before defining art, or any concept, we must define a far broader question: what
is the meaning of man's life on Earth? Maybe we are here to enhance ourselves
spiritually. If our life tends to this spiritual enrichment, then art is a
means to get there. This, of course, in accordance with my definition of life,
art should help man in this process . . . The problem with young people is
their carrying out noisy and aggressive actions to not feel lonely. And this is
a sad thing. The individual must learn to be on his own as a child, for this
doesn't mean to be alone. It means not to get bored with oneself, which is a
very dangerous symptom, almost a disease . . . Cinema is an unhappy art as it
depends on money, not only because a film is very expensive, but it is then
also marketed like cigarettes . . . The film for the large audience cannot be
poetical. Some films have been seen by millions of people . . . now it's
difficult to surprise the spectator, and good films are not seen by the
masses.

Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME, his most inaccessible film but also his heaviest
one and the one that most openly expresses his vision, as raw and unpolished as
it is beautiful, the desert as eternity, Man obliging his duties and enduring
the motions but inwardly gasping for breath, longing and failing, one
insignificant figure trickling across the majestic, colossal landscape, the
passing of time its only certainty, the characters' private, lifelong reach for
meaning externalized as sea-splitting spectacle, opens with this quote: "The
flag is still. The wind is calm. It is the heart of man that is in turmoil." In
the beginning, nature is still. For but an instant, the heart sings, and all
too quickly the bird's song fades, leaving the universe to its original
silence. But over the brow of enough mountains, exasperation settles into
peace: Wong Kar Wai said on a separate occasion, "There's a Chinese poem which
is very beautiful: 'The blossom will always be there, but the faces will
change.'" This beauty isn't from having no choice but to resign at the
inevitable that the world which once was ours is being involuntarily taken
away. It is the peaceful acquiescence after the long rage and denial in the
face of the ultimate loss, that of the self, when one is no longer standing
under the heavy rain but understands that no matter how heavy the rain, the sun
is always shining behind the dark clouds. Towards the end of Ozu's TOKYO STORY,
Setsuko Hara is asked earnestly by a younger woman, "Isn't life
disappointing?", to which she, having been widowed and having witnessed her
parents-in-law be left behind by their children as they pursue their own
interesting lives, as we all do, leaving the older generation to pass,
maintains her smile in the Japanese composure and reserve, a sadness under the
smile not even betrayed by the eyes, and replies without a thought, "Yes, it
is." Yes, in the melancholic, staid peace of wisdom, without flailing or garish
blathering or resorting to hedonist escapades, but merely calmly stepping
towards our turn when it comes.

<h4>2021-07-21, 三.</h4>
Giacometti created sculptures of the walking man, as towering as they are
thin—the walking man standing tall and confident, hurried in his stride, too
busy to pause at the mirror to see his own emptiness and insubstantial being,
just one passing evening wind. So too Gao Xingjian painted silhouettes of
vague, isolated wanderers placed in a ghostly, intangible, shifting, empty
landscape, pieces whose brushstrokes breathe fading life yet whose poignant
weight carries the same tone as Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL in which Man can
only dance around but never evade Death, only Gao Xingjian's figures are
nameless, faceless, unknowable, themselves forgettable and forgotten. These are
our parents, children, friends, and every soul that is presently inhaling air
who will in no time at all meet the same end as those who have long returned to
ash and soil. This is us, and the private, individual anguish can for just a
moment be soothed by recalling that prior generations have already crossed the
finish line, and we are merely continuing along at our own sweet pace. March
forth like the soldiers in Masaki Kobayashi's film trilogy THE HUMAN CONDITION,
whose marching line evokes Bergman's ending dance, because we are all in line
for the same twilight finale. All we can do is greet it and dash it the faint
human smile.

<h4>2021-06-29, 二. On Authenticity In Art, Politics, and Taxes.</h4>
David Foster Wallace mentioned a few interesting ideas when he said:
<blockquote>
Let me insert one thing, which I'll bet you've noticed from talking to writers,
is that most of the stuff we think we're writing about in books is very
difficult to talk about straight out, you know, question-and-answer, and in
some sense it probably can't be talked about directly, and that's why people
make up stories about it.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The idea of being a citizen would be to understand your country's history and
the things about it that are good and not so good and how the system works, and
taking the trouble to learn about candidates running for office . . . When
people don't do that, here's what happens. The candidates win who have the most
money to buy television advertisements because television advertisements are
all most voters know about the candidates. Therefore, we get candidates who are
beholden to large donors and become, in some ways, corrupt, which disgusts the
voters and makes the voters even less interested in politics, less willing to
do the work of citizenship . . . Talking about this now, I feel ashamed,
because my saying all this sounds like an older person saying this like a
person lecturing, which in American culture sets me up to be ridiculed. It
would be very easy to make fun of what I'm saying, and I can hear in my head a
voice making fun of this stuff as I'm saying it. And this is the kind of
paradox, I think, of what it is to be a halfway intelligent American right now
and probably also a Western European. There are things we know are right and
good and would be better for us to do, but constantly it's like, 'Yeah, but
it's so much funnier and nicer to go do something else, and who cares? It's all
bullshit anyway.' . . .  The paradox is that sort of tension and complication
and conflict in people also make them very easy to market to, because I can say
to you, 'Feeling uneasy? Life feels empty? Here's something you can buy or
something you can go do.'
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
There's probably more demand for serious books in Europe, but here there's a
small pocket of probably, I don't know, half a million, say a million readers,
many of whom are from the upper classes and have good educations and have been
taught the pleasures of hard work in reading or music or art and like that. I
mean, when you're talking to me, you're talking to someone who doesn't have
very much power in the culture and who's not very important except in a fairly
small—I don't know what the analogue would be. It would be something like
contemporary classical music in the U.S., which there are people who enjoy it
and listen to it, partly because of training and partly because they are
disposed to be willing to do a certain amount more work reading it. But
compared to popular music and rock and roll and hip-hop and stuff, classical
music is nothing, economically or commercially or in terms of how many people
have heard of it or how much an influence it has on the culture . . . I think
in the U.S., people who have been doing serious stuff, which is harder and
stranger, have always played to a much smaller audience . . . Reading requires
sitting alone in a quiet room, and I have friends, intelligent friends, who
don't like to read—it's not just bored—there's an almost dread that comes up
here about having to be alone and having to be quiet. And you see that when you
walk into most public spaces in America, it isn't quiet anymore. They pipe
music through, and the music is easy to make fun of because it's usually really
horrible music, but it seems significant that we don't want things to be quiet
ever anymore. And to me, I don't know if I can defend it, but that seems to me
to have something to do with, when you feel like the purpose of your life is to
gratify yourself and get things for yourself and go all the time, there's this
other part of you that's almost hungry for silence and quiet and thinking
really hard about the same thing for half an hour instead of thirty seconds,
that doesn't get fed at all . . . I think it's true that here in the U.S. every
year the culture gets more and more hostile. It becomes more and more difficult
to ask people to read, or to look at a piece of art for an hour, or to listen
to a piece of music that's complicated and that takes work to understand.

<blockquote>
In the United States, there is another divison, between corporate publishers
and non-profit publishers, who are often very small and do a lot of poetry and
avant-garde fiction. If you are 'lucky' enough to be published by a corporate
publisher, you get more exposure, you get reviewed in the New York Times
instead of just in your local paper, you get translated into other languages,
but literary stuff loses money for corporate publishers almost all the time,
and one of the ways they try to keep from losing money is marketing the
stuff—having the author go around and talk and read—the thing they most like to
do is send you to a bookstore and you give a reading . . . and that generates
free advertising for the book.
</blockquote>

Sally Rooney's take on it:
<blockquote>
Writers turn up to events full of people from a particular class, with a
particular educational background, and essentially the writer sells them the
product which is cultured existence in the form of a commodity, and the
commodity is a book. And people can purchase this book and therefore purchase
their way into a seemingly cultured class. And all the money that changes hands
in the book industry is actually just people paying to belong to a class of
people who read books.
</blockquote>

David Foster Wallace goes on:
<blockquote>
When there's a question-and-answer at the end of a reading, the question is
easy to answer if it's dull or stupid. The good questions are the questions that
can't be answered in a Q-and-A format. They're ones you have to sit down with a
pot of tea or a pot of coffee. They are things that can only be answered in
conversation between two people, and so I always feel vaguely fraudulent . . .
It makes me nervous and self-conscious to try to talk about stuff that I find
almost impossible to talk about, or else to just go, 'So how long are you in
town?'—'Oh, three days.' . . . The whole going around and reading in bookstores
thing, it's turning writers into penny-ante or cheap versions of celebrities.
People aren't usually coming out to hear you read. They're coming to see what
you look like and see whether your voice matches the voice that's in their head
when they read, and it's all—none of it is important.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If you do work like this, you pay certain prices. You don't make as much money,
not as many people read your stuff, but the people who are reading it and are
interested in it—the thing I like about doing this kind of stuff is that I'm
pretty sure my readers are about as smart as I am. I think if you're someone
like Crichton or someone who's a Harvard M.D. but you're writing for a mass
audience, things get very strange. I don't worry that people who are reading my
stuff are misunderstanding it or banalizing it . . . This is something else
about being an American. When I hear 'existential' now, half of me rolls my
eyes—'Oh, what a big sexy philosophical term.' And it becomes hard to speak
seriously about it because all I can hear is being made fun of how serious and
boring and dull I'm being.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I know that there's a paradox in the U.S. of, the people who get powerful jobs
tend to go to really good schools, and often in school you study the liberal
arts, which is philosophy, classical stuff, languages, and it's all very much
about the nobility of the human spirit and broadening the mind. And then from
that, you go to a specialized school to learn how to sue people or to figure
out how to write copy that will make people buy a certain kind of SUV . . . I'm
not sure really that it's ever been all that different. There are things about
my job that I don't like, but this is one of them I do like, is that I get to
use everything I've ever learned or think about . . . I know that there is, at
least in America, an entire class of—and now I'm talking about a very specific
class here—I'm talking about upper and upper-middle class kids whose parents
could afford to send them to very good schools where they got very good
educations, who are often working in jobs that are financially rewarding but
don't have anything to do with they got taught was important and worthwhile in
school.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
What it seems like here is that, television and corporate entertainment,
because it's so expensive, in order to make money it has to appeal to a very
wide audience. Which means it has to find things that a lot of people have in
common. What most of us have in common here are our very most base,
uninteresting, selfish, stupid interests—physical attractiveness, sex, a
certain kind of easy humor, vivid spectacle. That's stuff I will immediately
look at, and so will you. So it's in our very most base and childish interests
that make us a mass. The things that make us interesting and unique and human,
those interests tend to be wildly different between different people.
</blockquote>

David Foster Wallace said this in 2003. Not much has changed, and nor will it,
but indeed he suspected correctly that things have never really been all that
different. In 1880, Dostoyevsky wrote in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV:

<blockquote>
Taking freedom to mean the increase and prompt satisfaction of needs,
[people] distort their own nature, for they generate many meaningless and
foolish desires, habits, and the most absurd fancies in themselves. They live
only for mutual envy, for pleasure-seeking and self-display. To have dinners,
horses, carriages, rank, and slaves to serve them is now considered such a
necessity that for the sake of it, to satisfy it, they will sacrifice life,
honor, the love of mankind, and will even kill themselves if they are unable to
satisfy it . . . I ask you: is such a man free? . . . And therefore the idea of
serving mankind, of the brotherhood and oneness of people, is fading more and
more in the world, and indeed the idea now even meets with mockery, for how can
one drop one's habits, where will this slave go now that he is so accustomed to
satisfying the innumerable needs he himself has invented? He is isolated, and
what does he care about the whole? They have succeeded in amassing more and
more things, but have less and less joy.

I'll now switch to politics. This first paragraph is directed not at sensible,
well-meaning Republicans but those who follow and agree with Tucker Carlson and
Laura Ingraham. Republicans, scream election fraud all you want; two can play
that game. Populists, if you are so wary of intellectuals, to science, to
thinking and evidence, do you go to the dentist when you have a toothache? To
the hospital when you have cancer? Trusting intellectuals is not socialism.
Physical distancing and wearing masks during a global pandemic caused by an
airborne virus is not socialism. Raising taxes on the rich is not socialism.
The personal income tax, corporate tax, and estate tax are not socialism. If
you think higher taxes for the rich also means higher taxes for struggling
farmers, you've been duped by people who sell their agenda by calling it your
individual liberty when they buy their islands, hide in their bunkers at the
outset of a pandemic, and, when Earth is not enough, race each other to fly to
space. How disgraceful have you become not only as a political party but as
people when you refuse to investigate an attack on your own Capitol? Consider
for a moment the possibility that those you revile as intellectuals spend
considerable time thinking about problems you yourself do not, and sometimes
facing truth requires putting aside blind national pride. How is it possible
with all the knowledge and advancements of modernity we have in America a
movement steeped in
<a href="https://www.studioatao.org/post/understanding-anti-intellectualism-in-the-u-s">anti-intellectualism</a>?
Let me get to the point. Religious fundamentalists teach distrust towards
intellectuals to silence alternative worldviews in an increasingly secular
society where they are losing power as their followers, becoming
self-sufficient, break away. And what happens when anti-intellectualism is
taken to the extreme? History offers a few data points. In 1915, Ottomans,
fearing Armenian independence, began their genocide first with the
intellectuals to remove leadership. In the 1960s Mao launched the Cultural
Revolution in China in which for a full decade academics, scientists,
professors, and any intellectual ranging from those employed in the
institutions down to recent college graduates, all associated with the
bourgeois, were implicated and were marched in public in humiliation, beaten,
killed, or sent to work on farms, and schools and universities were closed,
sending scholarship and literacy down a monumental backslide in a country that
had for many centuries prized education, all to consolidate power for himself
in the name of glorifying the people, whose descendants now are more drawn to
material excess than the humility of the long time prior. We in American have
not yet descended so low, but when the people elect someone who withdraws from
the WHO, seriously considers pulling out of NATO, promises to revive the coal
industry, and repeatedly disregards the recommendations of scientists during a
global pandemic, do we suppose we are heading in the right direction? In
antiquity, Plato advocated for a philosopher king, and through all the progress
we've made since then we've come to be threatened by duplicitous capitalists
appealing to irrational fear and incompetence. After the Capitol rioters
succeeded in seizing the building, looting and destroying, they meandered
about, having ridden the tide of hysteria and rage to find themselves without
any idea what to do next, pawns to someone afraid of losing power.

I'll now talk reasonably. This section talks about taxes and also, because this
topic relates to wealth, politics. Full disclosure: I'm not an economist or a
tax lawyer, nor do I believe I'm going to change anyone's views on this. The
question of whether the rich are already being taxed enough seems nearly as
difficult as the question of whether a God or gods exist. You already have an
answer you believe in, and what you see will either confirm your position or
raise your suspicion at its correctness. For those who like me are not experts
in tax research and who are interested in my side, which calls for equitable
redistribution of resources, the notable researchers are these French
economists:
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q_E5lH4AAAAJ&hl=en">Thomas Piketty</a>,
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qZpr_CQAAAAJ&hl=en">Emmanuel Saez</a>,
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GbOivREAAAAJ&hl=en">Gabriel Zucman</a>.
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PhDDPiUAAAAJ&hl=en">Raj Chetty</a>
also does promising and very interesting work on the country's inequality and
unequal access to opportunity. But case in point on the difficulty of the tax
question: in 2011 Saez, with Nobel laureate Peter Diamond, calculated that the
optimal tax rate for the highest income bracket in the U.S. is
<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.25.4.165">73%</a>.
Currently, it is
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/publications/federal-tax-rates-and-tax-brackets/#brackets">37%</a>.
The principle behind this high rate is optimal tax theory, which aims to
maximize everyone's well-being without inhibiting innovation. For comparison,
AOC's proposed tax rate is 70% on—this is key—only income higher than $10
million. The great majority of American families do not reach that threshold.
Then, a paper like
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2550936">this</a>
points out the logistical impracticalities of raising taxes.
And
<a href="https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2019/optimal-top-tax-rates-review-critique">this</a>
from Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, modifies two parameters in the
model. The author writes of the original paper, "They argued that, if the
Pareto parameter is 1.5 and the ETI is 0.25, then 'τ* = 1/(1 + 1.5 × 0.25) = 73
percent'. If that formula is accepted uncritically, then the conclusion follows
from the premises. But neither the formula itself, nor the two parameters
(Pareto and elasticity) need be accepted uncritically. If this was a recipe for
baking a cake, it might be prudent to question both the recipe and the
ingredients." The author also writes, "with empirically credible changes in
parameters, the Diamond‐Saez formula can more easily be used to show that top
U.S. federal, state, and local tax rates are already too high rather than too
low." However, the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank
supports the high rate,
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-income-taxes/">writing</a>,
"The policy implications of this research are that increasing top marginal tax
rates can raise substantial sums of revenue and potentially dampen the rise of
income inequality without unduly restraining economic growth." I think this
kind of disagreement is ridiculous. For comparison, even though machine
learning research has a lot of bloat and myriad models, parameters, and
modifications to explore, at the end of the day there is consensus on a model's
performance because researchers don't question the evaluation metrics. But when
it comes to taxes, because money is involved, where a right-leaning think tank
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/rich-pay-their-fair-share-of-taxes/">says</a>
the rich are already paying their fair share, a left-leaning one has
<a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/decades-of-rising-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s-testimony-before-the-u-s-house-of-representatives-ways-and-means-committee/#share">data</a>
suggesting they don't. Opposing
<a href="https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/1-chart-how-much-the-rich-pay-taxes">these</a>
facts are also
<a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-fairness-briefing-booklet/fact-sheet-corporate-tax-rates/">these</a>.
And what does the public think? One
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/04/growing-partisan-divide-over-fairness-of-the-nations-tax-system/">poll</a>
shows 60% of Americans say that it bothers them a lot that some wealthy people
don't pay their fair share, and that views on the country's tax system is
increasingly colored by political affiliation.

I think the interesting question isn't: Are the rich paying their fair share of
income taxes? but rather: Why is inequality still rising when the rich are
already paying so much? By "so much", I mean the fact that in 2018 the top 1%,
according to the two conservatives' links at the end of the paragraph above, the
numbers also corroborated by another Tax Foundation
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/publications/latest-federal-income-tax-data/">article</a>,
earned 21% of all income but paid 40% of federal income taxes, and the top 10%
earned 48% of the income but paid 71% of the taxes. Before I go further, I
think it's important to put these numbers in perspective. Using a flat rate for
simplicity, taxing 20% on someone making $100,000 does not have the same effect
on the standard of living as 20% on someone making $10,000,000, which would
produce a much larger share of the taxes between the two. I think the answer to
this question: Do the rich pay their fair share of income taxes? is: yes. But
this is not the right question because income is only part of the picture. You
might wonder how inequality is still rising if the wealthy pay their fair share
of income taxes. Conservatives are hesitant to talk about the other variable:
existing wealth. The real equation of annual net worth growth is:

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white; text-align:center;">
net worth growth = income + wealth growth - debt growth
</pre>

where

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">
income = salary, wages, interest, dividends, etc.
wealth growth = stock appreciation, real estate appreciation, etc.
</pre>

Among the rich, wealth growth dominates. I'm going to focus on wealth growth
from stocks which, in our current system, favors those who already own them,
and those with more shares benefit disproportionately from rising values and
begin to own more and more, i.e. the game is rigged. Piketty wrote a more
complete discussion on this kind of growing inequality in CAPITAL IN THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. Piketty traced the history of wealth and inequality and
observed that when investment growth alone outpaces the rest of the economy,
the inevitable end is rising inequality. His recommended solution is a
progressive wealth tax, which is what I also believe in. It is crucial to keep
in mind that the wealth tax is separate from the income tax most people are
familiar with. The wealth tax is imposed on already acquired wealth which for
the rich is the main instrument for wealth growth, a method that is out of
reach of most Americans. The U.S. has never had a wealth tax, and it is not
hard to imagine who might go to extraordinary lengths to prevent one and why
they might call it unconstitutional.

In 2019, the Federal Reserve released a
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019017pap.pdf">paper</a>
describing the rising wealth inequality:
<blockquote>
At the highest level, the [Distributed Financial Accounts] show significant
wealth concentration and a clear increase in wealth concentration since
1989 . . . In 2018, the top 10% of U.S. households controlled 70 percent of
total household wealth, up from 60 percent in 1989. The share of the top 1% of
the wealth distribution increased from 23 percent to nearly 32 percent from
1989 to 2018. The increase in the wealth share of the top 10% came at the
expense of households in the 50th to 90th percentiles of the wealth
distribution, whose share decreased from 36 percent to 29 percent over this
period . . . [T]he bottom 50% of the wealth distribution experienced virtually
no increase in their nominal net worth over the last 30 years, resulting in a
fall in total wealth share from 4 percent in 1989 to just 1 percent in 2018.
The rise in wealth concentration stems primarily from increased concentration
of assets . . . with trends for assets largely mimicking those for overall
wealth. The share of assets held by the top 10% of the wealth distribution rose
from 55 percent to 64 percent since 1989, with asset shares increasing the most
for the top 1% of households. These increases were mirrored by decreases for
households in the 50-90th percentiles of the wealth distribution . . .
[W]e observe that the share of real estate held by the top 10% of the wealth
distribution has increased by 5 percentage points from 39 percent to 44
percent, suggesting that increases in wealthy households' share of real estate
holdings have contributed to the increase in concentration . . . [C]orporate and
noncorporate business equity have been large drivers of wealth concentration.
The distribution of these assets has long been skewed: in 1989, the richest 10%
of households held 80 percent of corporate equity and 78 percent of equity in
noncorporate business. Since 1989, the top 10%'s share of corporate equity has
increased, on net, from 80 percent to 87 percent, and their share of
noncorporate business equity has increased, on net, from 78 percent to 86
percent. Furthermore, most of these increases in business equity holdings have
been realized by the top 1%, whose corporate equity shares increased from 39
percent to 50 percent and noncorporate equity shares increased from 42 percent
to 53 percent since 1989.

The paper contains charts of the data, but it's easier to go to an
interactive version for the
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WFRBST01122,WFRBSN09149,WFRBSN40176,WFRBSB50203">stock dataset</a>
from the Federal Reserve's database. We see that stocks are predominantly owned
by the wealthy, and their share has grown in the last 30 years. The share
among the top 10% in Q1 1991 was 79.7% and rose in Q1 2021 to 88.7%. We also
see that since at least as far back as 1989, the bottom 50% have never owned
more than 1.8% and in 2021 owned 0.6%, which is next to nothing. Another
dataset shows the
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WFRBST01134,WFRBSN09161,WFRBSN40188,WFRBSB50215">net worth distribution</a>,
and the same pattern emerges. The share among the top 10% in Q1 1991 was 60.3%
and rose in Q1 2021 to 69.8%. The bottom 50% never owned more than 4.3% since
1989 and in 2021 owned a mere 2%. The Pew Research Center also has
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/psdt_01-10-20_economic-inequality_1-4/">data</a>
showing the growing wealth inequality. When we also account for wealth, the
question "Do the rich pay their fair share?" takes on a different meaning. The
income tax numbers that conservatives toss about are only skirting around the
issue. That the top 10% earned 48% of one year's income but paid 71% of the
year's taxes no longer puts the burden on the poor when we see that the bottom
50% have almost nothing to tax. According to the Tax Policy Center,
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-fact/income-salaries-and-wages-ff-06212021">the portion of income</a>
from salaries and wages also diverges by income class. For households with an
adjusted gross income less than $500,000, most (71%-81%) of the income came
from salaries and wages—from working. For households whose AGI is at least $10
million, that portion shrinks to 17%. The majority of their income likely comes
from bond interest and dividends—from their wealth by either investing or
owning shares of their own company. Inequality also plays out in college
admissions. An
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">article</a>
from The Times visualizes data from a study co-authored by Raj Chetty and Saez,
finding that:
<blockquote>
At 38 colleges in America, including five in the Ivy League . . . more
students came from the top 1 percent of the income scale than from the entire
bottom 60 percent. Roughly one in four of the richest students attend an elite
college – universities that typically cluster toward the top of annual
rankings. In contrast, less than one-half of 1 percent of children from the
bottom fifth of American families attend an elite college; less than half
attend any college at all.
</blockquote>

It is important to distinguish between groups within the top 1%, which has its
own massive internal inequalities. The Chicago Booth Review has an
<a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent">article</a>
that differentiates the average income in 2015 between four segments in the top
1% (0.5%-1%, 0.1%-0.5%, 0.01%-0.1%, and the top 0.01%), and even in this
echelon, the wealthier acquire wealth faster; each step from one group to its
next higher group is a jump on an exponential curve, from $485 thousand to $901
thousand to $2.9 million to $18.9 million. The richest group, the 0.01%, are
the 1 percenters of the 1 percent. Inequality.org gives a more concrete look at
the wealthy, splitting the top 10% into five groups and gave a brief
descriptive
<a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/taxing-rich-starts-knowing-who-they-are/">profile</a>
of each one. One investment manager suggests that there is a large divide
between the bottom and top halves of the top 1%. In 2011 he
<a href="https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/power/investment_manager.html">emailed</a>
Bill Domhoff at WHO RULES AMERICA? the trouble he saw in the economy's
inequality, particularly as caused by the top 0.5%. He remained anonymous to
protect his identity since his clients are primarily the ones he is
criticizing, as they "largely fall into the top 1%, have a net worth of
$5,000,000 or above, and — if working — make over $300,000 per year." He writes
of the lower half:
<blockquote>
The 99th to 99.5th percentiles largely include physicians, attorneys, upper
middle management, and small business people who have done well . . . The net
worth for those in the lower half of the top 1% is usually achieved after
decades of education, hard work, saving and investing as a professional or
small business person. While an after-tax income of $175k to $250k and net
worth in the $1.2M to $1.8M range may seem like a lot of money to most
Americans, it doesn't really buy freedom from financial worry or access to the
true corridors of power and money. That doesn't become frequent until we reach
the top 0.1% . . . Our poor lower half of the top 1% lives well but has some
financial worries. Since the majority of those in this group actually earned
their money from professions and smaller businesses, they generally don't
participate in the benefits big money enjoys. Those in the 99th to 99.5th
percentile lack access to power . . . Unlike those in the lower half of the top
1%, those in the top half and, particularly, top 0.1%, can often borrow for
almost nothing, keep profits and production overseas, hold personal assets in
tax havens, ride out down markets and economies, and influence legislation in
the U.S. They have access to the very best in accounting firms, tax and other
attorneys, numerous consultants, private wealth managers, a network of other
wealthy and powerful friends, lucrative business opportunities, and many other
benefits. Most of those in the bottom half of the top 1% lack power and global
flexibility and are essentially well-compensated workhorses for the top 0.5%,
just like the bottom 99%. In my view, the American dream of striking it rich is
merely a well-marketed fantasy that keeps the bottom 99.5% hoping for better
and prevents social and political instability. The odds of getting into that
top 0.5% are very slim and the door is kept firmly shut by those within it.
</blockquote>
The investment manager then describes the upper half:
<blockquote>
Membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some
aspect of the financial services or banking industry, real estate development
involved with those industries, or government contracting. Some hard working
and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as $15M-$20M before
retirement but they are rare. Those in the top 0.5% have incomes over $500k if
working and a net worth over $1.8M if retired. The higher we go up into the top
0.5% the more likely it is that their wealth is in some way tied to the
investment industry and borrowed money than from personally selling goods or
services or labor as do most in the bottom 99.5%. They are much more likely to
have built their net worth from stock options and capital gains in stocks and
real estate and private business sales, not from income which is taxed at a
much higher rate. These opportunities are largely unavailable to the bottom
99.5% . . . The picture is clear; entry into the top 0.5% and, particularly,
the top 0.1% is usually the result of some association with the financial
industry and its creations. I find it questionable as to whether the majority
in this group actually adds value or simply diverts value from the US economy
and business into its pockets and the pockets of the uber-wealthy who hire
them. They are, of course, doing nothing illegal . . . A highly complex set of
laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the
uppermost reaches of the U.S. financial system. It allows them to protect and
increase their wealth and significantly affect the U.S. political and
legislative processes. They have real power and real wealth. Ordinary citizens
in the bottom 99.9% are largely not aware of these systems, do not understand
how they work, are unlikely to participate in them, and have little likelihood
of entering the top 0.5%, much less the top 0.1%. Moreover, those at the very
top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules. I am not
optimistic.
</blockquote>
In a 2014 addendum, the investment manager wrote:
<blockquote>
One might think that physicians, America's highest-paid professional group,
would be largely exempt from the economic currents affecting most other
Americans. This isn't so. Medscape, a key physician website, reports that as of
2013, mean income for male physicians in all specialties was $259k; for female
physicians, it was $199k. Family practice doctors and internists earned the
least, averaging around $175k. Orthopedic surgeons earned the most, averaging
around $405k; they are the only physician specialty falling within the top 1%
by income . . . If our hypothetical physician saves and invests for 35 years,
he will have contributed less than $2 million dollars to retirement plans . . .
Thus, an average physician — while doing very well by most people's standards —
is unlikely to earn or accumulate enough to place him or her in the top 1% by
income or net worth at the end of their career. Opportunity for most Americans,
even physicians, is decreasing, even while net worth and income accelerate for
those at the very top of the system. If an average physician today is unlikely
to make it into the top 1% (Piketty and Saez's end-of-2012 data show that the
1% income line is crossed with an income of $396k per year), then it seems
pretty clear that crossing that line via income, savings, and investments will
be impossible for nearly every American in the future.
</blockquote>

He wrote also about someone who put up with finance enough to retire early, and
her account of investment banking reminded me of academia, only the currency
there is not money, and there's not so much as damage to anything as a large
part of it will never see the light of day and has no other purpose than
publication:
<blockquote>
Recently, I spoke with a younger client who retired from a major
investment bank in her early thirties, net worth around $8M. Since I knew she
held a critical view of investment banking, I asked if her colleagues talked
about or understood how much damage was created in the broader economy from
their activities. Her answer was that no one talks about it in public but
almost all understood and were unbelievably cynical, hoping to exit the system
when they became rich enough.
</blockquote>

What does net worth growth look like for those in the highest echelon? Let's
look at Stephen Schwarzman's in 2020. I have nothing personal against
Schwarzman; he has a history of philanthropy, and he's signed The Giving
Pledge. I'm just using his wealth as an example. According to Reuters,
Schwarzman
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackstone-group-ceo-compensation/blackstone-ceo-schwarzman-took-home-610-5-million-in-2020-idUSKBN2AT2V7">received</a>
$86.4 million in compensation and $524.1 million in dividends from his
Blackstone shares, for a total income of at least $610.5 million. What about
his wealth growth, considering solely his earnings from Blackstone? According
to the same link, he owns 19.3% of Blackstone, which had
<a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/BX/shares_outstanding">682.91 million</a>
shares outstanding in 2/2020, so he owned 131.8 million shares. Using stock
price
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BX/">data</a>
from Yahoo Finance:

<pre style="padding:0; border:0; background-color:white;">

       $53.84                  $64.81              $10.97           $1.4B
</pre>

Forbes
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/stephen-schwarzman/?sh=ffc2fea234a2">shows</a>
his net worth in 4/2020 was $15.4 billion and rose to $19.1 billion in 9/2020,
so he has more earnings than from Blackstone alone. Because the government does
not tax wealth, it is only when Schwarzman sells his shares that his earnings
get taxed. If Schwarzman holds on to his shares for at least a year, which he
already has, he avoids paying the higher rates of the ordinary income
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#brackets">tax brackets</a>
(10%-37%) and gets charged the
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#capgains">lower rates</a>.
(0%-20%) of long-term capital gains. But what happens if Schwarzman doesn't sell
his stocks? From a recent ProPublica
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">report</a>:
<blockquote>
The notion of dying as a tax benefit seems paradoxical. Normally when someone
sells an asset, even a minute before they die, they owe 20% capital gains tax.
But at death, that changes. Any capital gains till that moment are not taxed.
This allows the ultrarich and their heirs to avoid paying billions in taxes.
The 'step-up in basis' is widely recognized by experts across the political
spectrum as a flaw in the code.
</blockquote>
Dividends from stocks, however, do count as taxable income, but investors can
avoid that burden by choosing companies that reinvest in themselves rather than
pay dividends; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway does not pay dividends. If
the rich avoid receiving income, how do they pay for their large purchases?
I've not yet mentioned the third variable in the net worth growth equation:
debt. It turns out that if you're ultrawealthy, you can borrow money to avoid
taxes. According to the same ProPublica report:
<blockquote>
For regular people, borrowing money is often something done out of necessity,
say for a car or a home. But for the ultrawealthy, it can be a way to access
billions without producing income, and thus, income tax. The tax math provides
a clear incentive for this. If you own a company and take a huge salary, you'll
pay 37% in income tax on the bulk of it. Sell stock and you'll pay 20% in
capital gains tax — and lose some control over your company. But take out a
loan, and these days you'll pay a single-digit interest rate and no tax; since
loans must be paid back, the IRS doesn't consider them income. Banks typically
require collateral, but the wealthy have plenty of that.

Abigail Disney, an heiress of the Disney family, is among the exceptions in
America's aristocrats in that she has a conscience to admit the failings of the

Nowhere does ProPublica assert that these men cheated, lied, or did anything

worse, these methods and practices—things such as offsetting income with losses
in unrelated businesses; structuring assets to grow rather than generate
income, then borrowing against those growing assets for cash needs; and
deducting interest payments and state taxes from taxable income—are so
downright mundane and commonly applied that most rich people don't see them as
unethical. The more interesting question is not how the men in ProPublica's
report were able to avoid paying much or anything in federal income taxes, but
why. What motivates people with so much money to try to withhold every last bit
of it from the public's reach? . . . Having money—a lot of money—is very, very
nice. It's damn hard to resist the seductions of what money buys you. I've
never been much of a materialist, but I have wallowed in the less concrete
privileges that come with a trust fund, such as time, control, security,
attention, power, and choice. The fact is, this is pretty standard software
that comes with the hardware of a human body. As time has passed, I have
realized that the dynamics of wealth are similar to the dynamics of addiction.
The more you have, the more you need. Whereas once a single beer was enough to
achieve a feeling of calm, now you find that you can't stop at six. Likewise,
if you move up from coach to business to first class, you won't want to go back
to coach. And once you've flown private, wild horses will never drag you
through a public airport terminal again. Comforts, once gained, become
necessities. And if enough of those comforts become necessities, you eventually
peel yourself away from any kind of common feeling with the rest of humanity.
The older I've gotten and the more clearly I've understood these things, the
more the impulse to betray my own class has taken charge of my judgment. What's
shocking about the ProPublica report is not just that the tax bills are so low,
but that these billionaires can live with themselves.

Abigail Disney also references David Foster Wallace's THIS IS WATER commencement
speech in 2005 at Kenyon College, during which some in the audience laughed in
humor at certain points from the habit of watching too many sitcoms without
realizing the brutal reality of what was being said, provoking a rage like
watching an arthouse film among a jovial audience that has no idea what's
being shown on screen, and then realizing not everyone comes from your
background, sighing in resignation, and recalling that we are all nothing: "All
I know is that if you are a fish, it is hard to describe water, much less to
ask if water is necessary, ethical, and structured the way it ought to be."

To an average American family earning $70,000 a year, an additional $10,000
makes a sizable impact. To someone in this stratosphere, an additional million
or two makes no meaningful difference. In the end, there are two choices for
the ultrawealthy: 1) signing
<a href="https://givingpledge.org/">The Giving Pledge</a>
to give to charity most of the fortunes made in their lifetimes by their own
accomplishment, which Schwarzman and Buffett have done, and 2) starting a new
capitalist dynasty like these
<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-richest-families-in-america/">families</a>
whose heirs know it is best to stay away from the limelight, instead protecting
their wealth by calling for lower taxes and lobbying in various forms, such as
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/estatetaxfinal.pdf">repealing</a>
the estate tax, calling it the death tax to scare the common American to whom
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-many-people-pay-estate-tax">the tax would never apply</a>.

The wealth tax isn't a new idea; it's already been proposed in politics. Bernie
Sanders
<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/">proposes</a>
a wealth tax that would:
<blockquote>
only apply to net worth of over $32 million and anyone who has a net worth of
less than $32 million, would not see their taxes go up at all under this
plan . . . This tax on extreme wealth would have a progressive rate structure
that would only apply to the wealthiest 180,000 households in America who are
in the top 0.1 percent. It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above
$32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5
million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000. The tax rate would increase to 2
percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500
million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5
billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion,
and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for
singles. Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over
15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and
power of this small privileged class.
</blockquote>
This last sentence, of course, would not make the referenced class happy.
Elizabeth Warren's more lenient
<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax">version</a>
of the wealth tax raises the minimum threshold at which the tax starts and has
lower rates: "Zero additional tax on any household with a net worth of less
than $50 million (99.9% of American households)." The tax for the wealthy
is: "2% annual tax on household net worth between $50 million and $1 billion",
and for billionaires: "4% annual Billionaire Surtax (6% tax overall) on
household net worth above $1 billion". Furthermore, research suggests that more
equitable distribution of economic growth leads to more opportunity for all.
Raj Chetty
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6336/398.full">found</a>
that:
<blockquote>
rates of absolute mobility have fallen from approximately 90% for children
born in 1940 to 50% for children born in the 1980s. Increasing Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rates alone cannot restore absolute mobility to the rates
experienced by children born in the 1940s. However, distributing current GDP
growth more equally across income groups as in the 1940 birth cohort would
reverse more than 70% of the decline in mobility. These results imply that
reviving the 'American dream' of high rates of absolute mobility would require
economic growth that is shared more broadly across the income distribution.
</blockquote>
We have data that confirm that taxes successfully redistribute income and reduce
inequality. Our World in Data
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality#redistribution-through-tax-and-transfer-policies">visualized</a>
income distributions before and after taxes, as they currently stand, for
multiple countries and found that "inequality is not only reduced by
redistribution between individuals at a given point in time, but also by
achieving redistribution over the course of life." OWID also has an
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-inequality-gini-index?tab=chart&country=USA~FRA~DNK~DEU~ISL~GBR~CHE~SWE~ITA~NOR">interactive visualization</a>
comparing inequality between the U.S. and several European countries. The U.S.
notably has the highest inequality, and lowest inequality is in the group of
Scandinavian countries which have higher taxes to support a broader system of
government services.

I should mention explicitly that I do not support socialism. It didn't work out
well for the countries that ran that experiment, but unbridled capitalism leads
to growing inequality and does not yield equal opportunity for all. Inequality
is presumed and necessary in capitalism, but what is the right level of
inequality? One
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437115003738">paper</a>
proposed that the fairest inequality is a lognormal distribution. The paper
hasn't generated much interest, and I suspect this is a hard problem, not to
mention the politics involved, so this question is not one I'm going to
explore.

I don't think the main driver of the economy relates solely to taxation, but a
classic Republican claim is that lower taxes jumpstarts the economy. I'm not
convinced. If an old-school Republican points to Reagan's economic success by
lowering taxes, I'll point out that Clinton did better
in terms of
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Presidential_Comparison_Real_GDP_-_v1.png">GDP</a>
and
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Job_Growth_by_U.S._President_-_v1.png">job growth</a> with higher taxes on the
wealthy. The Federal Reserve has job growth
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USPRIV">data</a>
since 1939 in absolute terms. Clinton did
<a href="https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/textonly/WH/Accomplishments/Small_Business.html">lower taxes</a>
for businesses, but it was for small businesses, not the wealthy. It certainly
wasn't a trickle-down utopia. And Mike Pence recently
<a href="https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/bidens-china-first-tax-plan-americans-come-last-presidents-jobs-plan">wrote</a>:
<blockquote>
Under the Trump-Pence administration, we proved that low taxes are the key to
creating prosperity for Americans of every background and income group. In
2017, we passed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which delivered more than
$3.2 trillion in tax relief to American families and businesses. Within months,
our economy took off like a rocket. America gained more than 7 million new
jobs, unemployment plummeted to the lowest rate in 50 years, and more than 10
million people were lifted off of welfare—the largest reduction in poverty in
modern history.
</blockquote>
Actually, they didn't prove anything. The two job growth links above put Pence's
claims in context. In addition, we can compare Trump's numbers and Obama's.
FactCheck.org
<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/obamas-final-numbers/">summarized</a>
the numbers at the end of Obama's
term: "The economy gained a net 11.6 million jobs. The unemployment rate
dropped to below the historical norm." The numbers Pence mentions were not caused by Trump's
TCJA. The unemployment rate data
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE">show</a>
that by the time Trump took office, unemployment was already in decline, a trend
Obama started when he became president in 2009 immediately after the recession.
If Trump improved on Obama's performance, we would see a steep drop in
unemployment starting in 2017, but we don't. Again, Trump's TCJA didn't prove
anything. What about Biden's tax proposal? Lately there's been a lot of
intimidating news about it, with some calling it outright socialism. I will not
give them more coverage by linking to them, but Biden's tax hike is not
socialism. According to the Tax Foundation's
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/biden-tax-plan-tracker/">Biden tax tracker</a>,
Biden's tax hike to fund his infrastructure plan would "raise the top marginal income tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent".
How does this compare to the historic rates? The Tax Policy Center has
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates">tabulated</a>
the top marginal rate from 1913 to 2020. Biden's new rate of 39.6% is the same
as Clinton's when he was in office between 1993 and 2001. What Biden is
proposing is not socialism. For a complete listing of the tax bracket history,
the Tax Foundation has a
<a href="https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/fed_individual_rate_history_nominal.pdf">document</a>
that shows all the rates between 1913 and 2013. Furthermore, no one called the
taxes socialism in the 1950s when the top marginal rate was 91%. To be fair,
this high rate should be construed with a grain of salt because in fact the
effective tax rate for the rich was not much higher than it is these days. One
<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/taxes-on-the-rich-1950s-not-high/">analysis</a>
shows that "between 1950 and 1959, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an
average of 42.0 percent of their income in federal, state, and local taxes.
Since then, the average effective tax rate of the top 1 percent has declined
slightly overall. In 2014, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an average tax
rate of 36.4 percent." This was perhaps because few households fell into the
top bracket or simply due to tax evasion. However, my point is that even the
91% rate of the 1950s was not rampantly labeled socialism the way Biden's
proposal currently is. It's not socialism. The Tax Policy Center has also
<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/biden-would-raise-taxes-substantially-high-income-households-and-corporations-cut-taxes">analyzed</a>
Biden's tax increases: "Nearly all of President Biden's proposed tax increases
would be borne by the highest income 1 percent of households—those making about
$800,000 or more . . . At the same time, Biden would cut taxes for many low-
and moderate-income households and reduce them substantially for those with
children." All the scare about impending doom sounds to me like the wealthy
don't want to pay more taxes to help relieve the country's inequality.

The idea of fixing economic inequality is only a start. This is the solution
that's obvious in light of the data, and it's what progressives push for, yet
policy changes, redistributing wealth, and improving opportunities are not
adequate solutions when we assume we understand the working class without
actually seeing their perspective and troubles. If you are reading this, you in
all likelihood are not in this class. David Shipler's THE WORKING POOR:
INVISIBLE IN AMERICA offers a profile:
<blockquote>
The man who washes cars does not own one. The clerk who files cancelled checks
at the bank has $2.02 in her account. The woman who copyedits medical textbooks
has not been to a dentist in a decade. This is the forgotten America. At the
bottom of its working world, millions live in the shadow of prosperity, in the
twilight between poverty and well-being. Whether you're rich, poor, or
middle-class, you encounter them every day . . . Those with luck or talent step
onto career ladders toward better and better positions at higher and higher
pay. Many more, however, are stuck at such low wages that their living
standards are unchanged. They still cannot save, cannot get decent health care,
cannot move to better neighborhoods, and cannot send their children to schools
that offer a promise for a successful future. These are the forgotten
Americans, who are noticed and counted as they leave welfare, but who disappear
from the nation's radar as they struggle in their working lives. Breaking away
and moving a comfortable distance from poverty seems to require a perfect
lineup of favorable conditions. A set of skills, a good starting wage, and a
job with the likelihood of promotion are prerequisites. But so are clarity of
purpose, courageous self-esteem, a lack of substantial debt, the freedom from
illness or addiction, a functional family, a network of upstanding friends, and
the right help from private or governmental agencies. Any gap in that array is
an entry point for trouble, because being poor means being unprotected. You
might as well try playing quarterback with no helmet, no padding, no training,
and no experience, behind a line of hundred-pound weaklings. With no cushion of
money, no training in the ways of the wider world, and too little defense
against the threats and temptations of decaying communities, a poor man or
woman gets sacked again and again—buffeted and bruised and defeated. When an
exception breaks this cycle of failure, it is called the fulfillment of the
American Dream . . . The working individuals in this book are neither helpless
nor omnipotent, but stand on various points along the spectrum between the
polar opposites of personal and societal responsibility. Each person's life is
the mixed product of bad choices and bad fortune, of roads not taken and roads
cut off by the accident of birth or circumstance. It is difficult to find
someone whose poverty is not somehow related to his or her unwise behavior—to
drop out of school, to have a baby out of wedlock, to do drugs, to be
chronically late to work. And it is difficult to find behavior that is not
somehow related to the inherited conditions of being poorly parented, poorly
educated, poorly housed in neighborhoods from which no distant horizon of
possiblity can been seen . . . For practically every family, then, the
ingredients of poverty are part financial and part psychological, part personal
and part societal, part past and part present. Every problem magnifies the
impact of the others, and all are so tightly interlocked that one reversal can
produce a chain reaction with results far distant from the original cause. A
run-down apartment can exacerbate a child's asthma, which leads to a call for
an ambulance, which generates a medical bill that cannot be paid, which ruins a
credit record, which hikes the interest rate on an auto loan, which forces the
purchase of an unreliable used car, which jeopardizes a mother's punctuality at
work, which limits her promotion and earning capacity, which confines her to
poor housing. If she or any other impoverished working parent added up all her
individual problems, the whole would be equal to more than the sum of its
parts.
</blockquote>
Shipler wrote this in 2004 after spending time with people living in poverty.
The people he wrote about were demographically representative, across gender
and race. A more recent book provides the view specifically into the white
working class who support Trump, and policies would not help them without
knowing their problem, that their stresses cause them to dissociate from
participation, that, for many, they cannot see it in themselves to improve.
J.D. Vance writes of Appalachia's despair in HILLBILLY ELEGY:
<blockquote>
This isn't some libertarian mistrust of government policy, which is healthy in
any democracy. This is deep skepticism of the very institutions of our society.
And it's becoming more and more mainstream. We can't trust the evening news. We
can't trust our politicians. Our universities, the gateway to a better life,
are rigged against us. We can't get jobs. You can't believe these things and
participate meaningfully in society. Social psychologists have shown that group
belief is a powerful motivator in performance. When groups perceive that it's
in their interest to work hard and achieve things, members of that group
outperform other similarly situated individuals. It's obvious why: If you
believe that hard work pays off, then you work hard; if you think it's hard to
get ahead even when you try, then why try at all? Similarly, when people do
fail, this mind-set allows them to look outward. I once ran into an old
acquaintance at a Middletown bar who told me that he had recently quit his job
because he was sick of waking up early. I later saw him complaining on Facebook
about the 'Obama economy' and how it had affected his life. I don't doubt that
the Obama economy has affected many, but this man is assuredly not among them.
His status in life is directly attributable to the choices he's made, and his
life will improve only through better decisions. But for him to make better
choices, he needs to live in an environment that forces him to ask tough
questions about himself. There is a cultural movement in the white working
class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains
adherents by the day. Here is where the rhetoric of modern conservatives (and I
say this as one of them) fails to meet the real challenges of their biggest
constituents. Instead of encouraging engagement, conservatives increasingly
foment the kind of detachment that has sapped the ambition of so many of my
peers. I have watched some friends blossom into successful adults and others
fall victim to the worst of Middletown's temptations—premature parenthood,
drugs, incarceration. What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are
the expectations that they had for their own lives. Yet the message of the
right is increasingly: It's not your fault that you're a loser; it's the
government's fault.
</blockquote>
This feeling extends to the broader white working class. Arlie Russell
Hochschild called this feeling STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LAND:
<blockquote>
You are patiently standing in a long line leading up a hill, as in a pilgrimage.
You are situated in the middle of this line, along with others who are also
white, older, Christian, predominantly male, some with college degrees, some
not. Just over the brow of the hill is the American Dream, the goal of everyone
waiting in line . . . You've suffered long hours, layoffs, and exposure to
dangerous chemicals at work, and received reduced pensions. You have shown
moral character through trial by fire, and the American Dream of prosperity and
security is a reward for all of this, showing who you have been and are—a badge
of honor . . . Look! You see people cutting in line ahead of you! You're
following the rules. They aren't. As they cut in, it feels like you are being
moved back. How can they just do that? Who are they? Some are black. Through
affirmative action plans, pushed by the federal government, they are being
given preference for places in colleges and universities, apprenticeships,
jobs, welfare payments, and free lunches . . . Women, immigrants, refugees,
public sector workers—where will it end? Your money is running through a
liberal sympathy sieve you don't control or agree with . . . But it's people
like you who have made this country great. You feel uneasy. It has to be said:
the line cutters irritate you . . . You are a stranger in your own land. You do
not recognize yourself in how others see you. It is a struggle to feel seen and
honored . . .[Y]ou are slipping backward.
</blockquote>
It is this is feeling that found a voice in Trump in whom belated identification
has become hope, in whom anger has been given an authorized outlet. What's a
possible solution? I'm not qualified to offer one.

But strangers—Shipler also wrote a book about them, though through a racial
lens: A COUNTRY OF STRANGERS: BLACKS AND WHITES IN AMERICA. It was published
when I was 4, and I can still remember clearly the night of December 3, 1997
when my celestial glory, newspaper and coffee in hand, sat down in front of the
TV, eagerly waiting for him to appear on C-SPAN. Clinton, then president, was
holding a town hall to discuss race, and a recording is now available online.
The snippet I'm talking about is between 28:09 and 44:13, and this
<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?96122-1/town-meeting-race&start=1689">link</a>
defaults to its start. Shipler said:
<blockquote>
I feel that we're in a different phase of race relations in this country than we
used to be, and in some ways it's a more complicated phase. Bigotry, for the
most part, is not as blatant and obvious and outrageous as it used to be. A lot
of it has gone underground. It takes subtler forms, encrypted forms. Prejudice
is a shapeshifter. It's very agile in taking forms that seem acceptable on the
surface . . . I think for us as white Americans to understand some of this, we
have to reflect on some of the differences in experiences we've had as opposed
to those that Blacks and other minorities have had . . . I think in a dialogue
of this kind, the key is to listen, not just to talk . . . I'm hoping that if
we listen to each other, we can begin to diminish the size of that chasm and
perhaps even make this society of ours into less and less of a country of
strangers.
</blockquote>
Clinton added, "I don't think there is any legal policy answer to this. I think
this is something we've really got to work our way through." Beverly Daniel
Tatum was present too and said, "There's a lot of silence about these issues,
and I think breaking this silence is something many people are afraid of doing.
And as you pointed out we can't really fix this problem or continue the
improvement until we're able to engage in honest dialogue about that." On the
opposing side, Abigail Thernstrom, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a
conservative think tank, spoke about how far we've come since the 1960s and how
integrated the country had become. I think she meant well, but I think when you
pick certain data points, you can paint a better picture than how things are,
and relying on surveys for issues like race reveals less about outcomes and
behaviors than the prevailing fashionable attitudes of the time. When it's hot
out, it won't help to check the weather channel if your house is burning. Show
me your data, and I can show you segregation on a

doctors, like the entire sample, showed an implicit preference for [w]hite
Americans relative to Black Americans. We examined these effects among [w]hite,
African American, Hispanic, and Asian MDs and by physician gender. Strength of
implicit bias exceeded self-report among all test takers except African
American MDs.
</blockquote>
I can agree that by 1997 there had been progress compared to the 1960s,
according to the data that Thernstrom mentioned, but the message she's
conveying is that much progress had already been made, which begs the
question, "Why are people still worked up about this?", which leads to a
dangerous complacence. But an important thing to recognize is how in 1997 we
can sit down and talk about these things, disagreement or not. Two decades
later, how far have we come as a country? Anne Applebaum
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/milley-critical-race-theory-marxism-racism-fox-news/619308/">wrote</a>
in The Atlantic the importance of openness to ideas, starting with a class I was
vividly alive to be physically in:
<blockquote>
Back in the 1980s, comparative-literature majors at my university had to take a
required course in literary theory. This course—Lit 130, if memory
serves—offered prospective scholars a series of frames and theories that could
be applied to the reading of books . . . We suffered through a lot of turgid
academic writing, but the class had its uses. I learned, among other things,
that one can read the same text from multiple points of view and therefore see
different themes in it. When a Marxist reads Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice,
for example, he might become interested in the way in which wealth, power, and
the determination to have both shapes the lives of all of the characters. When
a feminist reads the same book, she might discover that patriarchal attitudes
toward women, who are judged and valued for their marriageability, shape the
lives of the characters too. The Freudians, as you might surmise, would notice
a whole different set of motifs . . . In his congressional testimony last week,
General Mark Milley endorsed the underlying philosophy of Lit 130, which also
happens to be the underlying philosophy of a liberal education: Read widely;
listen to everybody; make your own judgment about what's important. Here is how
he put it: 'I do think it's important actually for those of us in uniform to be
open-minded and be widely read.' The phrase widely read means that you can and
should read things you disagree with. You can definitely read Marx without
becoming a Marxist. You can read critical race theory without becoming
a 'critical race theorist,' however you define that . . . You can also read
American history in this same spirit, the way you would read a great piece of
literature, seeking to understand the complexities and the nuances, the dark
and the light, the good and the bad. You can be inspired by the Declaration of
Independence, horrified by the expulsions of Native Americans, amazed by the
energy of immigrants and frontier settlers. You can understand that the United
States is a great and unique country whose values are worth defending—and
realize simultaneously that this same country has made terrible mistakes and
carried out horrific crimes. Is it so difficult to hold all of these disparate
ideas in your head at the same time?
</blockquote>
Applebaum then critiques those on both extremes, the rabid critical race
theorists who can't tolerate dissidents and the far right that refuses to deign
even a nod to critical race theory:
<blockquote>
Soldiers should know, Milley declared, that African Americans were counted as
less than fully human until 'we had a civil war and Emancipation Proclamation
to change it.' It took 'another 100 years,' he noted, to get to the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. All of that should sound completely uncontroversial. It's
just a recitation of facts about American history, things that most people
learn in elementary school. But to Fox News's Tucker Carlson, the mere
suggestion that you should seek to understand your own society, including its
flaws, makes you a 'pig' and 'stupid.' Laura Ingraham, another Fox News host,
called for defunding the military in response to Milley's statements, on the
grounds that 'he's chosen to indulge the radical whims of Democrats.' The
Carlsons, Ingrahams, and other culture warriors who now dominate the world of
conservative infotainment seem now to believe that the study of American
history—the knowledge of what actually happened on the territory that lies
between the two shining seas—should be forbidden. The Republican-controlled
state legislatures and school boards that are currently seeking to ban the
teaching of 'critical race theory' have this same intention . . . But there is
another kind of person who might dislike Milley's attitude. Critical race
theory is not the same thing as Marxism, but some of its more facile
popularizers share with Marxists the deep conviction that their way of seeing
the world is the only way worth seeing the world. Moreover, some have
encouraged people to behave as if this were the only way of seeing the world.
The structural racism that they have identified is real, just as the class
divisions once identified by the Marxists were real. But racism is not
everywhere, in every institution, or in every person's heart at all times. More
to the point, any analysis of American history or American society that sees
only structural racism will misunderstand the country, and badly. It will not
be able to explain why the U.S. did in fact have an Emancipation Proclamation,
a Civil Rights Act, a Black president. This is a major stumbling block, not so
much for the legal scholars (some of whom actually merit the title 'critical
race theorist') but rather for the popularizers and the
scholars-turned-activists who want to force everybody to recite the same
mantras.

Listen to both sides! What a great idea that seems to come from common sense!

And what is the racialized experience like? Step back to 1992, when I, then -1
years old, frolicking in the ether and couldn't wait to materialize, about
thirty years before George Floyd's murder drew national attention, Jane
Elliott
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebPoSMULI5U">ran</a>
her brown eye/blue eye experiment, which reverses the direction of
discrimination, on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The video is half an hour long. If
you are white and are too uncomfortable to watch it to the end, how do you
suppose you can understand the many for whom this experience is America's
reality that the country has decided not to see? For people of color, they
would find in Jane the voice of grievance that working class whites have found
in Trump. Indeed, the experience of watching this video breaks through the
simple, naive, token emotions of one-dimensional happiness and joy of popular,
commercialized entertainment and touches briefly something of the heights of
literature, which is that humor and rage, truth and tragedy, mania and sanity,
life and its passing, are all one and the same.

When working class whites have been positioned at the front line to combat
others who have been historically oppressed, when neither group owns any
significant share of the country's wealth, is it not then obvious who is
fanning the flames? I don't think some mastermind is orchestrating some
conspiracy, but that those who live in everyday insecurity, when aggravated,
fall into a competition to get ahead of each other, and those who are more
privileged stand guard over their own possessions as they watch the chaos
unfold, laying out a narrative that even touching a fraction of the millions or
billions in their portfolios which they do not use stifles progress and
innovation or pushes the country towards socialism, when they clutch their
purses and think, "What business is it of mine to step in?"

Even with Trump out of office,
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/29/a-partisan-chasm-in-views-of-trumps-legacy/ft_21-03-24_trump_legacy_feelings_new1/">views</a>
on him have largely remained unchanged among Democrats and Republicans, and what
we will have in coming elections is more of the same contention, polarization,
and distrust across parties because the underlying issues of inequality remain,
susceptible to dirty marketing tactics by unscrupulous politicans more
interested in their lining their pockets than running a government. The trend,
however, is that younger generations are more liberal according to

A
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/coming-generation-war/588670/">projection</a>
indicates that by 2039, Gen Z and Millenials will consist of nearly 70%
self-identifying Democrats. Given these trends, it may not be too off the mark
to claim: if the country manages to not descend into civil war, then politics
in the next decades, whoever the next Trumpist demagogue is in 2024 and
thereafter, will resemble the stock market, waves of short-term volatility as
distractions to the inevitable trajectory towards progress when the younger
generations, more open, more tolerant, more willing to fix problems and move
forward, constitute growing shares of the electorate.

Yet progress of this kind poses another problem to a healthy democracy when it
turns into a one-party monopoly. The victory at the top also comes with the
isolation of not having a sparring partner of equal standing. What will become
of the Republican Party? How will conservative populism evolve to confront the
problems of modernity when it can no longer appeal to a declining constituency
invigorated by toxic bravado, narrow-minded calls to a past era that is not
returning, smokescreening actual issues by yelling, "Look at those evil people
changing things!", instead of constructive solutions. How will the new platform
of the Republican party mitigate the dawn of a glamorous new serfdom at Apple
Park, Zuckerberg Park, and Bezos Park with equitable job growth, balance the
tax rate of less than
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">4%</a>
among the 25 richest Americans and a certain
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html">politician</a>
who has a history of avoiding taxes with HILLBILLY ELEGY, THE WORKING POOR, and
HARVEST OF SHAME, while also addressing climate change instead of thinking it a
hoax? How much is ExxonMobil paying you?

And what will happen to the Democratic Party once its principal opponent fades
into something of the past? Will its coalition that put itself together, each
group advancing its own interests by absorbing its neighbors', held into one by
intolerable, toxic fumes coming out of the other side's pulpit, break into
foolish fragments as predictable as human nature, white women prioritizing
white women, Blacks voting for Blacks, Asians for Asians, Hispanics for
Hispanics, and white men, caught between race and gender, choose race and side
with white women? The results from last week's NYC Democratic mayoral primary
suggest just this kind of racial delineation. Putting the candidates' proposed
policies aside, a neighborhood's voter preference strongly resembles its racial
composition. The Times released an interactive district-level
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/23/nyregion/nyc-mayor-primary-results-precinct-map.html">map</a>
of how the city voted, which can be compared with a map of the city's racial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_York_City&oldid=1030916027#/media/File:Race_and_ethnicity_2010-_New_York_City_(5559914315).png">distribution</a>
Manhattan's core, predominantly white, voted for Kathryn Garcia. The Asian
neighborhoods, and oddly also the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Borough Park,
voted for Andrew Yang. And Harlem, the Bronx, and large swaths of Queens and
Brooklyn, in the Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, voted for Eric Adams or Maya
Wiley. I don't think these results are a coincidence, and if this is a
precursor to what will happen to the Democratic Party, then perhaps all one can
do is shrug in disappointment. If you say race is not a problem and you are
white, let me know again when I point out that the
<a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/children-are-at-the-forefront-of-u-s-racial-and-ethnic-change/">minorities</a>
of today will soon no longer be minorities and that Christianity, even
considered as the sum of its denominations, may very well not be the
predominant
<a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/">religion</a>
for much longer. This is the inconvenient problem of race, not as discriminatory
racism which also needs to be addressed, but as the country's identity shift.
Perhaps fortunately, this is a problem of time, and the free solution is the
passing of the decades, when the younger generations have already been slowly
acclimating to the changing face of America which in a gradual shift will not
seem out of the ordinary, like eyes seeing their reflection every morning but
don't notice the wrinkles accumulating on the face. If you say race is not a
problem and you are not white, consider what will happen when white Hispanics
start voting like whites, Blacks push for expanding affirmative action, Asians
insist on maintaining policing. What will become of race then? Time will tell,
but perhaps it'll only be a problem when people remain walled up in
self-interested isolation, but why not be spurred by the idea of trying
something new? Why not? How many in the American heartland still conceive of
New York as just the one in the past as sung by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrUfJW1JGk">Sinatra</a>
without also realizing there's also the modern ones by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsZlY0Vz4-o">Jay-Z</a>
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHKXYWZYH5E">Alicia Keys</a>?

Back to the present. I'll end this section on politics with
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/">comments</a>
of how each party feels about the other. It reads like a dysfunctional
relationship. Their words, not mine, but the Republican views I disagree with
are the ones that have no easy compromise and ones I don't think are promising
to address because they existed even before the current hysterical
polarization, distrust, cancel culture, and utter lack of communication between
parties, and which are not the cause of the country's intolerance towards the
other side but which only seem exacerbated because of growing economic
imbalance, when one side is naively scapegoating in a rapidly changing
demographic and the other stings with unaddressed racial and gender
inequalities. These issues are: abortion, gun rights, implementing religion
values in the law, and whether the Constitution should be adapted to the modern
country and not remain catered to the one two hundred years ago. I'll also take
the liberty to add that two hundred years ago was when people weren't able to
buy assault rifles, when slavery was legal and the original text
proclaimed, "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
several States which may be included within this Union, according to their
respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of
free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and
excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons"—until one
century later when an amendment repealed such nonsense.

Twenty years ago, the Korean singer Lee Jung-hyun introduced techo music to her
country's music industry. In Lee Jung-hyun's song
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stiFBReCjrs">WA</a>,
the brief spans of Eastern instrumentation evoke the sudden recollection of a
culture's past millenium before descending into spasmodic flailing that
violently inverts it, and then she starts singing into a microphone attached to
her pinkie. The performance is not as outlandish as Klaus Nomi but brings to
mind the absurd humor of LADY SNOWBLOOD, an absolutely ridiculous cult classic
whose eponymous lady, in her quest for vengeance, repeatedly fells squadrons of
armed men who back away from her every step, just one woman in a kimono walking
forward, who also sings her own theme song. The performance's aesthetic has no
meaning in the West, especially not in contemporary American pop music, where
excess is the norm, and flamboyant, ostentatious, garish images are merely
run-of-the-mill, and something far more provocative is never far away, an
unfortunate state of the industry in which little is left to the imagination or
contemplation and in which the outrageous can be met with perfunctory, unfazed
nonchalance. It does, however, stand out in the East, in a conservative culture
that mandates conformity and convention, in which anomaly does not have general
appeal without official sanction. Contrast Lee Jung-hyun's song with the
typical sulker, this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDywqSyQ3Mc">one</a>
in Cantonese, which is too prim, too proper, the colossal weight of the East's
ancient civilization bearing down on any born under its early-rising sun, too
sweet and cute and tame and sanitized, utterly without an independent voice
that contributes something to society that the culture would not otherwise have
had. Or saccharine excess taken over the top, losing most of its reserve and
inhibition in this Korean
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ">one</a>
that has the misfortune of being in a replaceable band in a music industry
that's productionized its pop star supply chain and learned to profit from the
fickle, the vogue, and the trendy passing fads in modern consumerism, but
perhaps I shouldn't be complaining if it boosts Asian representation and alters
the Pavlovian conditioning away from old stereotypes in mass culture, even if
it becomes a continuous stream of robotic, soulless Candy Crush. Every band has
its heyday, but I suppose we each have for us our own terminal time and place
whose only mystery is as difficult as filling in two variables. I'm not privy
to the details of Lee Jung-hyun's work but I wouldn't be surprised if she was
the one who envisioned the concept, convinced the producers on its viability,
wrote the lyrics, choreographed the dance, and went onto the stage doing her
thing, all 5'2" of her.

Needless to say, this sort of thing is possible only in the imprudent craze of
youth, and Lee Jung-hyun was 19 when she came up with the song; now in her 40s,
she has settled into staid comfort, having already done what she needed to do.
Why is it that our best moments are gone in a flash? Our collective fate is
expressed in the melancholic resignation of an Ozu or the inescapable
transience of a Naruse, and we can merely hold on to snapshots of a specific
space and its people in a bygone memory, flipping through a photo album to find
our identity: the rugged American individual in the Wild West in John Ford's
THE SEARCHERS and its landscape in Terrence Malick's BADLANDS, Patrick
Modiano's persistent and haunting German-occupied France, the intellectual
sphere and Jewish paranoia in Woody Allen's MANHATTAN. Or one from among the
evolution of Jia Zhangke who has taken it upon himself and cinema to chart the
experience of China's decades post-reform via his characters and, through
them, the zeitgeist of an entire generation hurtled, with all its angst,
longings, and emptiness, into modernity. Often, flames that shine the brightest
do not shine for long, and just as electrons jumping to higher orbitals soon
collapse back, so, too, David Foster Wallace emitted his contribution to
humanity in INFINITE JEST and then, while working on his next novel, about the
mundanity of human life viewed through employees at the IRS, took his own life
at 46. But, at least in my book, better a scintillating 40 years than 80 slowly
bled dry.

The film THE HOURS properly captures the writer's tortured inflection in Nicole
Kidman's wonderful portrayal of Virginia Woolf: private exasperation, breaths of
pain, conscious agony. She narrates at the end: "To look life in the face.
Always, to look life in the face, and to know it for what it is. At last, to
know it, to love it, for what it is." In her eyes is the sensation of bare feet
walking on broken glass, nails dragged across the blackboard, claustrophobia
under the skin, all silently suffocating as hushed secrets are heard from
another room's walls. Such too is the texture of Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS.
Any authenticity does not involve dilution by someone else's presence. George
Steiner said: "If you can phrase what to you makes life worth living, the
absolute center, it's a lie because it's nobody else's business. It's a
self-deception. I think it probably lies lower than speech or on the other side
of speech for many human beings. It is not articulable. It is certainly not
publicly communicable . . . What makes life worth living is so private a thing,
so intimate a thing, that articulacy conveys the constant danger of a rhetoric
of self-delusion, of exhibitionism. We are in a society of unparalleled
exhibitionism at every level." As Laozi's proverb goes, "He who knows does
not speak. He who speaks does not know."

The conventional story that has won the world over, with its excitement,
adventure, passion, is just one formula. Create a character. Name him or her X1.
Create a sidekick. Call him or her X2. Create a mentor. Name him or her Y. Set
it in a place and a time. Call it Z. Create a problem. Call it P. Fill in the
variables with whatever—what a bore. How refreshing it is, then, to know that
there is a joy in watching films touched by surrealism like David Lynch's
ERASERHEAD and MULHOLLAND DRIVE, or Seijun Suzuki's BRANDED TO KILL, or
Bergman's PERSONA, which also embodies the sheer delight of pure cinema. To
watch the edges of reality lapse is to feel again something of that unknowable
mystery of first consciousness, before it all becomes as predictable as
conversations already had, friends already made and gone, careers already
climbed, all dull and dry until we can taste the distilled mana that once
was—the singularity, the absurd, the sublime, that phase shift when wakefulness
fades into sleep every night and then one last time—to sail towards the black
hole and with the might of human hands wrest from it the makings of its innards.

Is not the only response to the fact of our eventual collective annihilation,
when fully understood and embraced not as some abstract notion restrained to
some distant future but as fate that can arrive even tonight, to resort to
humor and the realization that this journey is nothing more than: life
as illusion, life as a dream. Did Nietzsche not touch on this when he wrote,
"Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster . . .
for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you." The
consequence of his eternal recurrence is that everything anyone can ever do or
say or think has already been done, said, and thought. If life is understood as
merely motions and physicality, then we are all just playing with legos. Time is
space is space is time—we are at present, all at once, not yet born and living
and dead. Beckett wrote: "Have you not done tormenting me with your accursed
time! It's abominable! When! When! One day, is that not enough for you, one day
he went dumb, one day I went blind, one day we'll go deaf, one day we were born
and one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that not enough for
you? They give birth astride a grave, the light gleams an instant, then its
night once more."

Paolo Sorrentino's film THE GREAT BEAUTY ends in an eloquent reflection of what
we are, set to John Tavener's choral rendition of his countryman William Blake's
poem THE LAMB. The scene, narrated by the main character in a brief monologue,
watches an aged nun whose purity in life has made her near sainthood as she
reaches the top of the steps of a cathedral, choosing to pull herself up by
hands and knees, the camera in front of her zooming towards her face as she
finishes the ascent, bowing down to kiss her necklace, the holy cross, as it
comes to a rest on the floor of the landing. While we watch this moment with its
music surging towards the finality of tranquil divinity, the main character
summarizes us. He, conscious of modern Italy's culture of decadence in contrast
to the country's long history of beauty and triumph, its marble statuary
forgotten in basements as its youth dance the night away, observes the decaying
culture while immersing in it himself, who for many decades was unable to break
free. In the ending scene, in his native Italian, his voice joins the choir as
we watch ourselves in the nun: "This is how it always ends. With death. But
first there was life, hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It is all
settled beneath the chitter, the chatter, and the noise: silence and sentiment,
emotion and fear. The haggard, inconstant flashes of beauty, and then the
wretched squalor and miserable humanity, all buried under the cover of the
embarrassment of being in the world: blah, blah, blah, blah." The film closes as
the narrator at that moment realizes something and embraces the absurd, deciding
to begin his novel. He is standing on a cliff by the ocean, facing the love of
his youth, a woman on whom the film rests its last shot.

Rilke wrote, "Loving does not at first mean merging, surrendering, and uniting
with another person (for what would a union be of two people who are
unclarified, unfinished, and still incoherent?), it is a high inducement for
the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to become world, to
become world in himself for the sake of another person; it is a great,
demanding claim on him, something that chooses him and calls him to vast
distances . . . But this is what young people are so often and so disastrously
wrong in doing: they(who by their very nature are impatient) fling themselves
at each other when love takes hold of them, they scatter themselves, just as
they are, in all their messiness, disorder, bewilderment." But even Rilke,
champion of man as individual, believed in the possibility of love: "love that
consists in this: that two solitudes protect and border and greet each other."
The film director Wong Kar Wai meditates on this feeling of distance; his
signature is unmistakable. In spite of every element in the film running at the
full speed of life, his characters seem stuck in the eye of the tornado.
Although the camera is pushed so close to the actor that the face takes up half
the screen, although sugary pop music plays that evokes the high ebullience of
the teenage years, although we enter the character's head and hear the thoughts
as voice-overs spoken as if to a friend, although the film is so rich in
vibrant color, the shots so alive with active energy, although the film is so
flush with life, although we are brought so physically close that we can touch
their breath, this palpable fact remains: all his characters feel so far
away. Whether his film is set in his home city's modern metropolis, in a
foreign country where he does not speak the language, in a technocratic future,
or in a dystopian fantasy, Wong Kar Wai has been making just one film: the
longing for romance and the impossibility of intimacy, and all we can have is
timeless jazz, strobing lights, the rain outside, and moody puffs of smoke
rising from our cigarette. Wong Kar Wai's preoccupation with love tempts the
important question: what does it mean to be alive? This is a question Abbas
Kiarostami poses from another angle: should we bother to live? Abbas
Kiarostami's TASTE OF CHERRY takes as its style a stark austerity in which the
camera sits in the passenger seat watching a man drive about the desert,
looking for someone to bury him. The weight of the film is implicit, not in the
overt, unignorable manner of Francis Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW in which the
depths of consciousness is splayed in overbearing sweat and grime, or in
Tarkovsky's STALKER which forces upon us the texture of time and the dread of
liquid consciousness. How to capture life in film? Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD
is wonderful in concept but failed to deliver the punch. It followed its actors
over 12 years as they moved through life's stages, but the film's delivery
lacks the wonder and elevation of universality, its scenes reading as a series
of facts so proud of its idea that it hadn't bothered to put itself together
into a vision, the film's primary fault being that the director was not strong
enough. At the other end, Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE attempted to encompass
so much of life it loses itself in airy voice-overs in an unfocused daydream
that overwhelms but leads nowhere. If the point is to watch one family
interspersed with spectacularly shot moments of the sun, eclipses, and the
skies above, why not just settle with Ron Fricke's BARAKA and lose oneself in
the drawn-out documentary of the many human cultures across the world and be
drowned in detail?

We witnessed in John Conway's GAME OF LIFE that from simplicity dawns
complexity, that the workings of seeming causation and sentient life can come
on a board of pixels from all of three rules:

Birth: A dead cell with three live neighbors comes to life. <br>
Prolong: A live cell with two or three neighbors remains alive. <br>
Death: A live cell with zero or one neighbors dies of underpopulation; a
live cell with four or more neighbors dies of overcrowding.

From these three rules came life-forms, among them spaceships, gliders, clocks,
frogs, flip-flops, and beehives, and from these three rules have sprung what
have come to resemble civilization in the pixel. While the message from
simplicity is clear, Conway, a mathematician, made the mathematician's mistake
in thinking that actual life is so simple. Perhaps a modification to the death
rule should be made: a cell lasts the span of eighty breaths, but even this
doesn't convey the circumstance of the human condition in being aware of its
eventual demise. What are the set of rules enabling us? Are we merely hamsters
running on a wheel? Is consciousness real and not preordained as a set of
inevitable chemical reactions? Is reality in fact real? Cao Xueqin wrote in
DREAM OF THE RED CHAMBER: "Truth becomes fiction when the fiction's true. Real
becomes unreal when the unreal's real."

<h4>2021-04-04, 日. On Religion and Roger Scruton.</h4>
I'm an atheist, and today's post situates my views in the context of religion,
and why the religion question largely doesn't matter.

First, I will state some of my doubts. To even begin to convince me to believe
in God, you must answer this question of mine: why Jesus or Yahweh or Allah when
I can also choose Zeus and Hera, Shiva and Brahma, Isis and Osiris, Odin and
Ymir, Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl, Ababinili and Agu'gux, Hadad and Anu?
Why one god and not four hundred? Would God have been the next titular character
had Joseph Campbell extended his HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES? I can't shake off
the observation that those who are religious are religious because of a sense of
community and not because they are wholly convinced from first principles in the
existence of God. To convince me to be religious is to show me that faith is not
just the happenstance religion of the society into which we are born, assigned
at birth and immured as the sole option when we are too young to resist our
parents and our friends, too young to think and doubt, too young to realize that
by adulthood we will be too accustomed to holding on to faith out of nominal
identification with that community and not out of true belief.

I'm not speaking of religion in the way Alan Watts did when he used a marketing
ploy to slip God under the cover of mesmerizing rhetoric. The God he spoke of
was not the omnipotent deity of the Judeo-Christian tradition but a god
embedded in the personal and everyday, everywhere and needing no more worship
than a spiritual awareness. What a great cheat! How he committed the
intellectual laziness of conflating one god with another by using the same
terminology! The notion of God is too loosely defined. Do we agree with
Maimonides when he explained that the Jewish God is such a perfect unity that
he could not be described in any positive sense, and we cannot say God has arms
or legs, or that God is omnipotent, or that God has thoughts, for any such
statement limits the greatness of God? Surely one can follow this description
as one can follow a thought experiment, but no one can persuade me away from my
immediate thought: what a wonderful fiction!—though such a character is
certainly too dull for my book.

To live motivated by the thought that disorderly conduct towards your fellow men
earns you a one-way ticket to eternal condemnation seems to me immensely
self-centered because such a guiding principle suggests we have an eye towards
our own fates when we choose how to behave  towards others, and that propriety
is not a self-evident principle derivable from common sense and reason. How low
does this suggest of us and our fellow men that we can't be decent without fear
of punishment? Bertrand Russell wrote, "Religion, since it has its source in
terror, has dignified certain kinds of fear, and made people think them not
disgraceful. In this it has done mankind a great disservice: all fear is bad. I
believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive. I am
not young, and I love life. But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the
thought of annihilation. Happiness is none the less [sic] true happiness
because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value
because they are not everlasting. Many a man has borne himself proudly on the
scaffold; surely the same pride should teach us to think truly about a man's
place in the world. Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver
after the cosy indoor warmth of traditional humanising myths, in the end the
fresh air brings out vigour, and the great spaces have a splendour of their
own." One can enter the sublime by sitting in church in the front pew, enjoying
Bach's music playing under the towering apse just as one can enter it by lying
back on the open grass, under the constellations of the night sky, all on one's
own, contemplating  the stars whence one came; one can be spiritual without a
god. Humanity's pursuits—reaching for transcendence, enjoying music, living
virtuously, seeking meaning and purpose—what does God have to do with them?
Everything we've done, we've done without Him.

The most compelling argument for believing in God I've come across is Roger
Scruton's. Scruton did not dodge the hard questions, did not consider his views
an obvious truth, was not intolerant to conflicting views, and was not so
deluded in his own beliefs that he couldn't accommodate cross-examination.
During an interview he was asked, "God. We got rid of Him, finally. We finally
recognized we are totally alone in the universe. Oceans of time before us,
oceans of time after us—Schopenhauer—yeah? And amidst we are, giving meaning to
our lives, just one little second in eternity. And now you're coming up with God
again. In three or four minutes you're talking about a <i>moral</i> God." The
interviewer continued: "If we see our presence in the universe at this very
moment in time for 60 or 70 or 80 years as one whisper, and we can't give
meaning to our own lives because there are no preconditions, there is no God,
there is no moral statement in the universe itself, of the universe itself.
Isn't that more challenging than returning to the old idea of a moral God?"
Taken aback for a second from so direct a question, Scruton replied: "If you
want to live your life being challenged, that's fine. There are lots of things
more challenging than my worldview, but it doesn't follow they're for that
reason more true. It's possible for someone like Rilke to live with a kind of
death of God feeling, to say to himself, 'For God has been taken from the world,
along with so much else. I will now remake everything according to my own inner
light and find consolation there.' And to some extent, that's what I do, but not
everybody is Rilke. Most people, deprived of this kind of consolation, don't
rise to the challenge at all. They sink a long way beneath it, and they live
without that aspiration to be something better that they would otherwise have
had. And so I'm very much opposed to taking this sort of thing away from people.
If you lose it yourself, then of course that could be regarded as a misfortune,
or you might regard it a great liberation, as Nietzsche tried to do. But that's
your problem. You deal with it. I have my own way of dealing with it, and I
think I have dealt with it. I worked my way back to something, not really the
God of organized religion, but I worked my way back to something like a God
idea. I'm giving it a place in my life which enables me to stand to some extent
in judgment of myself, as I think I should." Fair enough. This answer satisfies
me, and I can respect Scruton for it. The necessary consequence, of course, is
that Scruton thinks we were both created in the image of God and that I have
fallen from favor, while I think his belief in an unprovable deity ludicrous. No
further word can be said that can change our minds, but this doesn't matter
because the thwarted conversation is postponed until the infinitude that comes
after the day when both of us are dead, when, as far as we're concerned,
everything ceases to matter. I may not agree with Scruton's views, but I can
respect him for adequately examining his convictions and living by them to the
very end.

I am not Richard Dawkins. I don't impose atheism on anyone. Freedom of religion
is one of the founding principles of the country. If you are religious, be
satsfied in your community, and I mine, which proclaims: We have no god to love,
and no god loves us, we do not believe in deities whose business it is to lord
over our miniscule lives, for we believe not in gods but in humanity. I can find
the religiously devout among those I consider at the pinnacle of humanity:
Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, William Blake, just as I can find among
them atheists. My gripe is not against religion itself but the lack of the
necessary search and labor to convince oneself beyond, "It's what everyone
around me believes, and we fear those who don't."

In America, we have a party that knows it is losing power and instead of a
graceful handover and adapting to the times, it resorts to pathetic measures
like gerrymandering and restricting the voting rights of Americans who are not
on their side, the whole party patently struggling to hold on to dear life. I
can respect Scruton, but I can't respect the whole line of Republican senators
who ride on disinformation, sending the wrong message to working class Americans
to vote against their interests so the rich can have lower taxes, those
Republicans who sell religious and national purity like Mitch McConnell—whose
wife happens to be Chinese and who is responsible for his wealth—and Ted Cruz,
and their predecessor William Buckley who would have rather resorted to lies
and elitism rather than accept progress. Why all the opposition to change?
Martin Luther posting his NINETY-FIVE THESES on a church's door sounds pretty
radical. A group of 102 religious pilgrims seeking religious freedom sailing on
the Mayflower to a new, largely unknown continent sounds pretty radical. The
French Revolution sounds pretty radical. This is the pattern of human
civilization: today's radical is tomorrow's past, as certain and unyieldable as
the iron law of history. As Schopenhauer put it, "All truth passes through three
stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is
accepted as being self-evident." For the logical among us, think of it this way:
jump forward on the timeline and look back; today's radicalism is already in the
past. This is not to say all change is progress. Marxism, Nazism, Communism,
Fascism, anarchy, populism, nuclear fallout, and nativism are not avenues of
progress. Progress is determined by what works as a push forward for humanity,
not by self-interest, power-mongering, greed, and blinkered nationalism.

The remainder of this post discusses Scruton. In considering my differences
against Scruton, I can't help but also notice the immense similarities, and I
recall Schopenhauer's  world as illusion, world as appearance, reality as but a
surface veneer. Schopenhauer took this idea from the ancient Vedic tradition,
which also had so inspired Hesse that one of his recurring projects was an
attempt to reconcile the West's dilemma between rationality and the animal
within against India's amorphous nature of reality. Peel away our differences—he
a conservative and I a liberal, his Christianity and my atheism, his British
reserve, stiff upper lip, preoccupation with dignity,  ever aspiring to serenity
and order, and my fearless charge towards intensity, passion, flame, grabbing
life by the horns, he who returns ever again to equilibrium when I say, "Why
bother resting? After this brief stint, we have all eternity for
equilibrium"—and there is more  in Scruton that I can respect not only because
of his unmitigated journey towards authenticity, but because the underlying
ideas guiding the way he lived his life are also mine.

Scruton defended Heidegger's notion of dwelling as "this attempt to reaffirm
with your connection with a particular place at a particular time and a
particular social web . . . Every serious idea is dangerous. In a civilized mind
it is not. It is an instrument of peace. I'm talking about peaceful existence in
a single place, an unthreatening form of being"—Scruton not only agrees with
this as an intellectual idea but lived by it. Scruton expands on this idea with
Hegel's homecoming spirit: "In all of us there is a desire for homecoming, where
we find ourselves having ventured out into all these dangerous experiments of
individual living, at last coming back, swallowing all our pride, and humbly
acquiesing in a social order which is bigger than ourselves." In these words
Scruton also captured the trajectory of his life, as he recounted his early
years: "I was very fortunate in having an unhappy childhood so that my desire
from the very beginning was to escape from it . . . I was very much aware of the
difference between me and everybody else, that there was something in me that
needed to be addressed. I had a question in my life. I didn't know what the
question was, but I knew that it needed an answer, and I had first to identify
what the question was. So the things that my contemporaries took pleasure in,
like football, cinema, whatever it might be, pop music, had very little
significance for me, even though like all my contemporaries of course I played
the guitar, a bit of bass guitar, and all the usual—things one had to do. But
even while doing it I regarded myself just as ridiculous as the people around
me." It was only later that Scruton gradually came upon how to pose the
question: "Someone like Heidegger would say it was the question of Being. What
and why am I? What is this soul doing in this environment, and how can  it
possibly come to be in that environment in a way that will bring peace to
itself?" In middle age, Scruton described his fear of choosing to abandon his
position as a professor as "being afraid to give up a career that I thought to
be certain and secure, but I knew that I should give it up because it was not
me, my career as a teacher. I finally got the courage to give it up, but I left
it very late." And in describing the broader fear of living, Scruton said, "When
you're confronted with this sort of fear, you might run from it into false
consolations, things which are not real consolations because they involve no
overcoming . . . I can see what it would be to take refuge in wine completely,
and allow that to soothe one through one's day and to soothe one through one's
inadequacies, to enable one to put this fear to one side.  That is not a
consolation. A consolation to me comes from having confronted trouble, and
eliciting from the heart of the trouble the resolution of it." Scruton examines
himself in the way of someone who has the habit of doing deep reflection: "I
have always worked very hard at my literary gifts, but in every direction
they've suggested, philosophical essays, fiction, anything that seems to come to
my pen, but it's always been enormous work, and I've always connected it
deliberately with my subjectivity, the peculiar confusion which I inherited by
being born the thing that I was. And I made them slaves, my literary works, of
my need, and each of them had the task of unraveling this confusion . . . except
for a few academic articles, all this has been a completely personal voyage of
discovery . . . so this was a very personal thing, which had nothing to do with
the normal <i>Bildung</i> of a normal academic philosopher. My life was a kind
of <i>Bildungsroman</i> in which the academic part was a sort of continuous and
enjoyable mistake. I shouldn't have been a teacher, or I shouldn't have been
locked away in libraries. My heart and soul have always been in other things,
I've always been involved in other things, which have always been more important
to feeding what I really think."

Scruton's first marriage failed, but his second marriage, at 52, to Sophie
Jeffreys, after a "slow, quiet, respectful courtship," not in the searing
passion of uninhibited romance but in the quaint charm, quiet serenity,
coquettish allure, and mutual attraction hidden beneath preserved dignity so apt
to the British manner, lasted until his death. Scruton composed a piece for the
piano dedicated to his wife "which would convey something of her composure and
orderliness." He called it BOREAS BLOWS NOT, referencing Herodotus: "Boreas
blows not through the young virgin who lives alone in the house with her mother.
Because at the time, Sophie was living alone in her house with her mother. So it
was a description of Boreas the north wind refusing to blow, or unable to blow,
through this secure little cottage." Scruton made for himself and his wife a
version of this little cottage, with a yard in the front for the horses he kept
for fox-hunting. In his cottage in the countryside of Wiltshire, on a plot of
land he bought that he named Scrutopia, Scruton lived out his years with his
wife among books lining the walls and a grand piano in the center of the living
room. True to his word, Scruton dwelled, playing Bach in his village's church
every Sunday. Scruton dwelled, returning to the countryside into which he was
born: "My childhood was in a semi-detached house by a railway line in which we
were, you know, very poor, very much living in the old class resentment of the
English . . . It has nothing to do with this. This here is created by books and
music in the middle of a countryside which I love and among people doing
innocent old-fashioned things with animals. That's as far as one can get." In
Wiltshire, Scruton lived until his death in January 2020. May he rest in the
peace of eternity that I too will one day join, hopefully having attained the
same peace in human terms.

<h4>2021-03-26, 五.</h4>
The great pessimist Emil Cioran once wrote, "Nothingness may well have been more
convenient. How difficult it is to dissolve oneself in Being!" With that, he
ended his essay, THE TEMPTATION TO EXIST. It is a revelation to read Cioran, who
also wrote books whose titles convey his essence such as ON THE HEIGHTS OF
DESPAIR and THE TROUBLE WITH BEING BORN, not to convert to nihilism, but to bear
witness to the pits of the philosophical abyss of life taken to the extreme so
that one no longer fears facing the dark unknown, for one has already seen it
and knows it and can say, "Ah, is that all?" I'm not a nihilist, but I do think
it is crucial to conceive the various avenues others have taken to grasp upwards
towards meaning, perhaps especially so when it fails, perhaps because we will
also recognize bits of nihilism in ourselves. Of course, the intellectual
resolution to nihilism is simple: life should have meaning, even though it
doesn't and the meaning itself is meaningless; what's the alternative? But what
is such a meaning worth pursuing in spite of its emptiness known from the
outset?  What makes a life not just a toy put together on an assembly line,
robot arms scheduled to add parts as the toy moves through its decades and
phases, the script and social constructs mandating the school years, the working
years, a family, retirement, and finally its end  when the toy is completed,
fully fabricated to specification as it is dropped off with its glorious
splendor in the dumpster with every other toy that has come before and will come
after, the toy smiling that it's been carried along the mechanization's selfsame
routine as it croaks its last breath, smiling the whole way because that's what
the toy has imagined to be its purpose. What makes a life worthy? The fact is we
all die one day. How hilarious! How lovely! But how disappointingly human. This
is the game we're playing, the time remaining on our turn ticking away, and when
it all ends it will have been oh so meaningless. It is better to address the
fundamental questions of life than to duck the head into the sand, ignoring the
necessity of truth, and blasting music at full volume in a buoyed state of
walking denial. How many times I've mused the question of life in a
conversation, to be redirected to a sudden distraction cropped up in avoidance.
Or a long book that spins itself in circles of words, occasionally reaching for
the famous name in an effort in vain, so bedazzled by its own verbosity that I
can't help but notice that the author may be more lost than me, so bloated in
conceit that he may no longer realize he's driven himself into irrelevance. But:
you're not answering my question. It's my most important one. I'll give you all
my time. Tell me something about life I don't already know.

<h4>2021-03-20, 六. On Asian America's Awakening.</h4>
This post is long overdue and comes in response to this week's shooting of six
Asians in Atlanta and to the broader issue of rising anti-Asian hate since the
start of the pandemic. Let's disabuse ourselves of the notion that racism is
some unprehensile abstraction in which we Asian Americans are not victims. This
very idea breeds illusions that, naively, it is largely a bygone evil, or,
falsely, that it doesn't exist, or, immaturely, that someone else will take care
of it. There's no reason to take it personally because these the symptoms of
racism are the same everywhere and are just as transferable to the next person.
They're not willy-nilly, wishy-washy, but persistent, predictable, unvarying,
systematic.

<b>Degrees of racism</b><br>
Unconscious bias<br>
Conscious convictions<br>
Online bigotry<br>
Microaggressions<br>
Institutional discrimination<br>
Passing comments<br>
Verbal aggression<br>
Physical assault<br>
Murder and genocide

These symptoms come on top of a backdrop of media's unilateral caricature and
stereotype since the 1800's when Asians first arrived to the country, none of
which is helped by our small population that leads to scant exposure in the
public consciousness. Like most things in life, these symptoms are sifted
through the unignorable influence of class and play out differently depending on
the stratum of the perpetrator. The struggling do not refrain from taking
more extreme measures and the privileged express themselves in subtler forms,
especially when they don't need to do it themselves.

I'm going to preface the rest of this post by saying that there are genuinely
decent folks whose only fault is simply that they have not been exposed to
multiculturalism and diversity and so don't have anything to form an opinion of
other races other than prejudiced and outdated textbooks from school and
exaggerated, distorted stereotypes gone unchecked. It is not them that I have
in mind but those blockheads like some 21-year-old who, guilty over his sex
addiction, turned his gun on someone else rather than the more obvious solution
of turning it on himself. Or those inhuman cretins who would run in full speed
up to a 91-year-old to push him to the ground. Or those blatant aggressors who
in spite of ample anti-racist messaging from government, news outlets, and
social media, in spite of common sense, in spite of any propriety or civility,
continue to lash out in blind hate. Or closeted bigots who so fear justice that
they keep their hysterical xenophobia to themselves, whatever their walk of
life.

I am not surprised whatsoever that Asians are being targeted. I can't help but
exclaim: how banal and boring! Tell me something new! As soon as the news broke
of COVID's origins last year I immediately anticipated such a development.
There is not the slightest indication in the racial history of this country
that suggests otherwise. On the contrary I would be surprised if this shooting
were the last. Count on it: discrimination and patent racism will continue once
life returns to normal and people resume congregating in person, in forms
subtle and explicit, verbal and behavioral, in school admissions, in job
applications, in fewer appointments for doctor and lawyers, in everyday
encounters. We do not have it worst; Blacks have had a far longer and bloodier
march against racism. We Asians have piggy-backed on the civil rights movement
and benefited from monumental progress towards true equality in the 1960s
without bearing the brunt of the melee. What makes us think we can surmount
racial boundaries if Blacks still have not? However, our problem is more akin
to the Jewish one: a small successful minority that—who knows?—might be
wealthier and more educated than our assaulters. And yet we do not have power,
we do not have bite—why? I can't be wrong in saying a large part of the reason
is that Asian culture obeys authority and doesn't stir trouble, overwhelmingly
preferring comfort and stability over due process and justice. Perhaps a
generation or two later, the offspring of this period's doctors, academics, and
engineers, comfortable enough in their social reproduction, will have the
chutzpah to take up the risk of fighting back.

Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, a Korean artist and writer, was raped and murdered in the
Puck Building in New York in 1982 and received no more news coverage than one
obituary in The Village Voice. When an Asian dies, the subtext is she was the
stereotypical passive victim, quickly banished to the side, the details of the
crime reduced to mere facts, leaving out any semblance of a relatable person.
Her friend Sandy Flickerman-Lewis recounts, "People only say that she died
young. The never indicate the horror." She says later, "Theresa was not passive.
She fought back." And why did Theresa receive such little coverage?
Flickerman-Lewis says, "She was just another Asian woman. If she were a young
white artist from the Upper West Side, it would have been all over the news."
If she were white, all over the news indeed! Seven years later in the same city,
Trisha Meili, who worked in corporate finance—but let me add the important
detail—she's white—was raped in Central Park, and what a public outcry! What
investigations, what litigations, what media coverage that even two decades
afterwards people were still talking about it! Here's the reason: someone white
is one of "us".  When asked to talk about Theresa's death, curators and scholars
reply with such numbing politeness that they come across not as complicit but
innocent: "We have always tried to focus on Cha's amazing work and not to
sensationalize her story", and refraining from mentioning her death "out of
respect for her famly, not to overshadow the work." Of course not. Asians are
one-dimensional tokens who, as artists, are only artists known through their
work and not actual humans who have lives outside their role. The record is not
any better served by the fact that Theresa died and Trisha did not, and she went
on to publish her memoir so that we the American public can relate to all the
minutiae of her lovingly concretized life.

An Asian get murdered and no one cares. And still we appeal to someone else! How
can we not laugh at ourselves! These are any number of the scenarios we may very
well find ourselves in: someone with a rifle walks into a store and starts
firing, someone sidles up behind you with a kitchen knife, or you're walking and
a car that passes by suddenly stops behind you and someone jumps out, charging
at you with an axe. Where are our surgeons and professors then? History repeats
itelf: the news flashes the breaking headlines, people signal the fashionable
politics, and it is erased all too soon, we forgotten under a quiet headstone as
the rest of the country returns to its unhassled business—let's pay lip service,
mope for two seconds, and continue about our ordinary day!—who cares about some
Asian? To my fellow Asians who remain meek from the ancestral culture,
unaccustomed to the reality, I have nothing to say but this: stop running and
hiding. Your children will not thank you for leaving the world the way it was
given to you. When someone throws rocks through your house's windows, when a man
forces himself through your doors, when a random kid runs up and pushes you to
the ground, when someone opens fire on your family, you stand and reply in kind
with the full force of rectified self-defense. We cannot remain handcuffed to
bookish intellentsia but must pick up the proper tools for the challenge.
Science communicates by theory and evidence. Writers communicate the human
experience across time and age—the best ones tend to be dead. Painters
communicate in exhibitions. Investors communicate with supply and demand.
Entrepreneurs communicate with their products. And violence so singularly
directed out of blind hatred demands its proper reply, in the only language that
brutes understand. Korean cardiologist, how ludicrous you are to inform your
assaulter you're Korean and not Chinese. Let me help you realize: he, like most
white Americans, doesn't care. If our response to this surge of pandemic racism
is simply overcoming personal inhibitions and deigning to share our encounters
with racist incidents, then the inevitable outcome is this: next month people
will forget because they simply can't be bothered. Has racism gone away for our
Black brothers and sisters who have been calling out racism in person, in
politics, in film, in literature, online, in the history books for so much
longer? Are you sure people care whether you're a Vietnamese refugee or a Korean
lawyer, a Japanese corporate expatriate or a Chinese software engineer? How do
you talk reason to someone who pulls a gun on you? Are you serious when you try
to teach empathy to a vandal in a mad frenzy to set your house on fire? Cry all
you wish on TV, write as many articles asking people to share their stories, do
your best to raise awareness, but nothing in the country's history points to any
help other than from yourself. Malcolm X said in 1963, "When we see our people
being brutalized by white bigots, white racists, we think they are foolish to be
beaten and brutalized and do nothing whatsoever to protect themselves. They are
foolish. They should have the right to defend themselves against any attack made
against them by anyone . . . There will come a time when Black people wake up
and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves . . . then
the Black man will think like a Black man, and he will feel for other Black
people, and this new thinking and feeling will cause Black people to stick
together, and at that point you'll have a situation where when you attack one
Black man you are attacking all Black men." Asian America, where is our Che
Guevara, our Malcolm X? Our Martin Luther King, our Gandhi? How long can you
still tolerate bigotry with docile appeals to justice and equality? Careers in
medicine, law, academia, science, engineering, technology, finance, and business
yield ample paychecks as you recede into your suburbs, gated communities, and
bubbles of anonymia.

News articles are written on anything Asian that no one bothers to skim, Asian
films are released that few watch, Asian books are published that even fewer
read. Make it anyways. Our problem is our small population that doesn't boast
the power of market demand and the lack of a cultural identity beyond ethnic
enclaves that do not command anything more than comfort food. How do we coalesce
into an identity if we don't create one worth rallying behind and if we won't
bother with it ourselves? Will we remain perpetually non-belonging? Is this our
shared fate with the Jewish? Isaac Deutscher wrote, "Trees have roots. Jews have
legs." But let's not forget that the Jews fought back too in World War II, the
many resistors like Hannah Senesh who did not simply flee. Or Niuta Teitelbaum
who stood up to three Nazis: "She blushed, smiled meekly and then pulled out a
gun and shot each one. Two were killed, one wounded. Niuta, however, wasn't
satisfied. She found a physician's coat, entered the hospital where the injured
man was being treated, and killed both the Nazi and the police officer who had
been guarding him."

Asian America does not need more quants, engineers, software developers,
mathematicians, research scientists, physicists, venture capitalists. Asian
America cannot lift itself into a veritable tour de force if its members
consistently pursue money and material comfort in finance, STEM, medicine,
research. Asian America lacks a gravity uniting the community because there is
no central culture, no film festivals, no great writers, directors, no proud
achievement to pass on as cultural heritage. Few of us create, few of us consume
serious art, few pay attention to what these few produce, and even fewer listen
to our stories. For good reason: our art has not reached parity. To be taken
seriously, we must be serious about art and not settle for bubble tea and K-pop,
martial arts films and farcical comedies. The generation coming of age is paving
the way, and doing so in earnest, able to hold their own without pulling the
race card and decrying, "Please look at me, for I am unrepresented; pity me
because I'm human too." Even still, with this slew of modern artists from among
us, the story arc is something along the lines of pain, echoing figments of
immigration, family trauma, outsiderness. This is a necessary phase, to address
in proper faith the sorrows and longings, the lost ancestral ties, the real,
lived exerience of our parents and childhoods, to cement into the collective
language a history of a people that this time shall not be forgotten. This phase
is our current state and will continue for years to come. We must however come
to a point where we change course and stop milking the trauma and claim the full
richness of what it means to be an ordinary person like any other, to be human,
unafraid to seize joy and wonder. Our stories must evolve beyond this initial
reflecting mirror of reverberating helplessness and encompass comedy, elation,
mischief, pride, community, poverty and wealth, failure and triumph, indeed
happiness—all on our own terms, in our own channels, in accordance to our own
morality, history, customs. Community therapy through stories are but half the
battle when they only resolve the shame, guilt, regret, dissonance of growing up
a minority and stop short of the statuary pointing towards a sustainable, bright
future. We complain of the lack of media representation but where are our
screenwriters behind the films representing our voice? Why do we expect a white
writer to see our side when all he has are antiquated stereotypes? Correcting
media representation is not something that can be given to us but something we
must take up ourselves; no one but we ourselves is going to present our
narratives, our artists and film directors and writers, and not just reaching
parity in merit but exceeding. Where are those among us who will join those
who've come of age—Cathy Park Hong, Ocean Vuong, Charles Yu, Lee Isaac Chung,
Chloe Zhao? Where is the Asian American luminary? Who is the Asian American
voice? Where is our Charlie Kaufman, Aaron Sorkin, Quentin Tarantino, our
Tarkovsky, our Bergman? our James Baldwin, our Toni Morrison, our fearless
rallying architect, our central vision? Where are our art industries, our art
magnates, our art instructors, our art market, our art attendance that isn't
just gimmick picture-taking, admittance into the gallery out of resigned
ignorance? Asian America, upwardly mobile, lacks a body to call its own, its
doctors, engineers, bankers disperse on their own, with no home culture. Where
is our unique voice, our prose style, our cinematic direction, our elevated
lyricism, our vision on our own terms, ideated, designed, implemented,
propagated, and consumed all by ourselves? The rookie mistake is to produce what
Jay Caspian Kang calls dignity porn: "The type of story that takes the life of a
seemingly oppressed person, excavates all the differences compared with the
dominant culture and then seeks to hold these up in a soft, humanizing light.
Look, the dignity porno will say: 'Kimchi isn't weird. Ergo, we are as human as
you.'" This is what the dominant culture expects of the race narrative, and it
is precisely what we don't do because such a paradigm reaches no higher than the
fundamental limits inherent to the form, the subaltern deriving his value as a
proposition against the hegemony. Just as the feminist Germaine Greer did not
seek equality with men because she did not gauge the woman as a partial against
the man, we expect more of ourselves. We do not create for the white audience,
we do not invent for the dominant culture, we do not subject ourselves as
targets of that repulsive brand of exoticized slapstick comedy relegated to
foreigners, uncomprehending and incomprehensible in all ways except a clown's
incompetence, we do not plead for dignifiying humanity as a least common
denominator, we do not withdraw into spineless anonymity, we do not dance for
the white gaze. We create for ourselves, our community, our parents who've had
no voice, our children who shall find their own among the highest culture.
Whiteness is not our barometer. If the white audience takes notice, we will not
turn anyone away because we do not discriminate, but what they encounter will be
ours, on our own terms. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, "What is the difference
between a bookkeeper in the Garment District and a Supreme Court justice? One
generation."

I must be clear: I do not advocate segregation but instead an adequate
substantiation of one part of the American experience. I'm on the same page as
Obama when he said, "What makes America America is all the outsiders, the
misfits, and the folks who try to make something out of nothing. Let me tell you
about America. We're Lewis and Clark and Sacagawea. We're the pioneers and the
farmers and the miners and the entrepeneurs and the hucksters—thats our spirit.
That's who we are. We're Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer, women who could
do as much as any man and then some. And we're Susan B. Anthony who shook the
system until the law reflected that truth—that is our character. We're the
immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores, the huddled masses
yearning to breathe free, Holocaust survivors, Soviet defectors, the Lost Boys
of Sudan. We're slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South,
the ranch hands and the cowboys. We're the storytellers, writers, poets,
artists, who abore unfairness and despise hypocrisy and give voice to the
voiceless and tell truths that need to be told. We're the inventors of gospel
and jazz and blues and bluegrass and country and hip-hop—and rock and roll—in
our very own sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom. We are
Jackie Robinson enduring scorn in spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to
his head and stealing home in the World Series anyway. We are the people
Langston Hughes wrote of, 'who build our temples for tomorrow's strong as we
know how.' We are the people Emerson wrote of, 'who for truth and honor's sake
stand fast and suffer long, who are never tired so long as we can see far
enough'—that's what America is, not stock photos or airbrushed history, or
feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others. We respect
the past but we do not pine for the past. We do not fear the future; we grab
for it. America is not some fragile thing—we are large—in the words of Whitman,
'containing multitudes.' We are boisterous, and diverse, and full of energy,
perpetually young in spirit. That's why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old
age of 25 could lead a mighty march. We honor those who walked so we could run.
We must run so our children soar. And we will not grow weary for we believe in
the power of an awesome God, and we believe in this country's sacred promise."

How romantic an America! But oh, how so far away.

wading our eternities

<br>

Even above the clouds, in the void of space, a comet used to glide gracefully
across the night sky at the strike of dusk. On the wintry evening of November
13, 1877, a budding comet-chaser, convinced he was the first to lay eyes on the
elusive cosmic jewel, named it Ewelina Hańska, no doubt after the Polish
aristocrat whose intentional anonymity and sustained distance to a youthful
admirer resembled the comet's increasingly rare sightings. He wondered in
frustration why, unlike all the other comets whose periods only shortened, she
seemed to be defying the unbendable laws of gravity. After grappling at length
with his formulas, his only conclusion was this: originally appearing with
nightly certainty, she must have detected that her dances were being watched
and, for this very reason, altered the course of her elliptical orbit, slightly
delaying her next approach to earth each time she felt a pair of eyes on her
scintillating ice, because, in truth, even comets have their moods. The earthly
youth, condemned to his grounded fate, had no choice but to sit and wait
patiently under the sea of motionless stars. Never missing a night, he watched
in horror as the new interval of several days between her appearances not only
did not abate in mercy but grew steadily as days became weeks, and weeks into
months. Sitting by his telescope, he would look for her in the vastness of the
cosmos, along previous trails long ingrained in his memory, in the varied
constellations where she had never been, probing through misty nebulas and the
shadows of blinding stars, searching without rest or reason, bargaining with the
heavens that he would settle into bed if only he had one glimpse of her
elongated tail of frozen dust. Eventually he had no choice but to give in to his
desire, resorting to the comfort of rolling ice cubes on his tongue as he waited
so that he could know the taste of Ewelina Hańska: astral mystery. A tenacious
lad who had never known defeat, he followed his longing with discipline,
discovering for himself what many ambitious men before him have had to learn,
which is that sometimes victory is out of reach even when pursued by sheer force
of will. A look of perpetual confusion gradually settled on his face, and more
than once in the marketplace he heard someone describe his anxious expression as
the bearing of someone who has known great sorrow, but the permanent ridges of
incomprehension that resembled wrinkles on his cheeks and forehead never
occurred to him as anything more than the spoils of war. When at last her
absence had broken all astronomical records, he realized he did not need the
excitement of an actual sighting or even the regimen of his nightly telescopy,
for not a day had passed when something did not happen to remind him of her. How
do I know this? Last week as I was enjoying myself at the library, I found among
three others this comet-chaser's name in the obituary section in that period's
premier newspaper, preserved in microfilm, dated five decades after Ewelina
Hańska's first sighting. It seems that after she stopped returning, he soon
abandoned the profession. The last thing anyone heard of him was that he had
left intact his workstation under the open stars, his telescope pointed at the
direction from which she had always arrived, his folding chair still warm.

I remember a passage I first read years ago. I must've been on the subway on
some odd afternoon when, seated at one end I saw myself in Mary Oliver's words:
"It is six A.M., and I am working. I am absentminded, reckless, heedless of
social obligations, etc. It is as it must be. The tire goes flat, the tooth
falls out, there will be a hundred meals without mustard. The poem gets written.
I have wrestled with the angel and I am stained with light and I have no shame.
Neither do I have guilt. My responsibility is not to the ordinary, or the
timely. It does not include mustard, or teeth. It does not extend to the lost
button, or the beans in the pot. My loyalty is to the inner vision, whenever and
howsoever it may arrive. If I have a meeting with you at three o'clock, rejoice
if I am late. Rejoice even more if I do not arrive at all."

<br>

<h4>2021-03-02, 二.</h4>

Last night I was in the Jordan Hall of Science scanning midterm exams to grade
later when I was brought to a pause in the day's motions.  It was that time
after classes had ended for the day and before what must commonly be dinnertime,
when the lecture halls and lobbies are empty under the quiet cover of the dark
night outside. I was standing in front of the scanner when I stopped for a
second, noticing the music. It was one of those small moments of unexpected
beauty, a spontaneous, joyful surprise. Someone downstairs was playing the
piano. Music flowed undisturbed through the multiple floors of the open atrium,
in that emptiness of an expansive space with high ceilings and a long hall but
without footsteps, without chatter, without presence. I resumed scanning the
pile of exams, deciding it was pleasant background music for a chore. Listening
a bit more, I recognized it was HALLELUJAH. It must've been a student playing
because of the intermittent missed note and brief halt, but these mishaps
weren't distracting enough to detract from the music. There is a rawness and
honesty in live music that is lost when it becomes too practiced, too
calculated, too professional, or when recorded to perfection and replayed until
the cows come home. She played HALLELUJAH a few times and then switched to a few
more with Pachelbel's CANON IN D. Removing a staple from an exam, I thought,
isn't this nice? There is beauty and delight even in the unprovoked moments when
I'm not seeking it. At that moment, I was content just being, to go about my day
doing something as simple as plucking out staples from paper, placing the paper
on a tray, and hitting two buttons on a screen. Why all my rages and
resignations? I wondered whether I shouldn't have done something like this
instead from the start, undemanding, uneventful, so that I may have had more
time and energy to cultivate inner peace. Maybe a librarian, an office clerk, a
lab technician? Wittgenstein at one point decided to be a hospital porter, that
monastic wanderer. A few years ago I planned a two-week trip to Kyoto,
entertaining the idea of becoming a monk. Needless to say, I didn't end up
renouncing the world; the visits to the temple were enough of a reality check.

Driving home, the piano's unexpected delight lingered, and I felt the vestiges
of a scene from THE SOPRANOS. A.J., the grandson, who recently discovered
existentialism through Nietzsche, visits his grandmother Livia in the hospital.
Livia, in the wizened brevity of those in old age who know too well the futility
of beating around the bush, tells the usual consequences of existential dread,
as cliche and dull as they are true. She says, "Why does everything have to have
a purpose? . . . If you want my advice, Anthony, don't expect happiness. You
won't get it, people let you down . . . but in the end you die in your own
arms." Indeed, the usual boring riff of disillusionment with life. So? What's
new? And then she ends with a thought that doesn't feel like the punch in the
gut that it is because she doesn't weigh down her delivery with the heavy tones
of grand philosophy: "It's all a big nothing. What makes you think you're so
special?"

Aye, Livia. You and me both.

<h4>2021-02-26, 五. On the Artist as Eccentric.</h4>
Why is it so common to find among creatives intolerable stubbornness,
intractable visions, beings who not only create uncanny works but also live in
aberration? The roaring litany of writers and artists, comedians and activists,
philosphers and actors, all those whose independence demand they be
uncompromisingly themselves, count among their ranks disproportionately
tumultuous lives where madness, passion, obsession, ailment, and insanity
correlate with ingenuity—so much so that this observation can be made: the more
eccentric the artist, the more productive and outstanding. This is as it must
be. The nature of art does not call for reason, health, normalcy, or sustainable
living, but rather an open embrace of the vivacity of life, whether they be
struck by calamity, malady, treason, failure, despair, subject entirely to
factors beyond their control, and then having the wisdom to recognize it in the
mirror and follow it.

The artist does not concern himself with the illusory promise of happiness and
joy because his muse never appears when happy. Rather, the artist does not
resist and even pursues the experimental, the new, the traces of suffering that
lead further and further into himself. How do we explain this trait that artists
take for granted as dearly as life's motto? Others have written about this
potent capacity. Keats called it negative capability. Martha Nussbaum said of
Mahler's KINDERTOTENLIEDER (tr. Songs on the Death of Children): "That music is
consoling because it brings you to terms with the finality of loss in such an
eloquent way. Now, I wouldn't have said of the KINDERTOTELIEDER, that's a
beautiful work. I think most listeners wouldn't use that word. It's a harrowing
work, but it's precisely for that reason that it's consoling . . . To me the
greatness of Mahler is his getting to the depths of the inexorability of loss,
and the real, deep pain that human life affords, and I think if you can't get to
the depth of that pain you also can't get to the heights of the joy of human
life." The artist reeks in Nietzsche's superman who said: "But you, also, my
brethren, tell me: What does your body say about your soul? Is your soul not
poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency? . . . What is the greatest
thing you can experience? It is the hour of great contempt. The hour in which
even your happiness becomes loathsome to you, and so also your reason and
virtue. The hour when you say: 'What good is my happiness? It is poverty and
pollution and wretched self-complacency.'" It is not without reason that
Tolstoy's ANNA KARENINA opens with, "All happy families are alike; every unhappy
family is unhappy in its own way". What story is there to tell that ends with
smiles all around? It is finished at the full stop. The principal trouble isn't
that there is a lack of content but that any such story does not even intend to
capture the human experience in any adequate form, real or imagined, but only a
sorry fantasy. There is a reason no serious artist or critic concerns himself
with happiness. To have a joyful, gregarious, harmonious life is to sedate those
impulses of the self that embody the wonderful spectrum of humanity. Happiness
is pleasing. Happiness fulfills. Happiness quenches. Happiness is indolent
satisfaction. Happiness does not answer the call to meaning—happiness is boring.
A happy story represents nothing. It says nothing, it expresses nothing—it is
nothing. Not every artist can explain what drives him, but all have at least
this in common, an instinctive understanding of what doesn't work. To be clear,
I need to add a disclaimer that I am not an elitist. Conventional happy stories
have a time and place, and the market that caters to it, with public's appetite
for it, have the purpose of leisure and entertainment for normal people who have
jobs in the day and families at home, and the producers for this market are
bounds and away more influential than any avant-garde conception sequestered in
exclusive circles. I enjoyed THE GAME OF THRONES too, but don't expect me to
take it seriously, or THE HUNGER GAMES, or any superhero amusement park like THE
AVENGERS coming out of Hollywood. They were not made for the artist and do not
expand human consciousness, they do not belong in the same category as Proust or
Hugo, and so do not deserve the  same consideration. Artists are eccentrics for
a reason. One does not expect a scientist to be without his discipline and
objectivity, so how can one expect an artist to live in conformity and produce
mere replicas of what already exists? How can one critique in earnest the
society in which he lives when he breathes in it, when behind his white lies he
stands to lose the most from brutal honesty? But also, how does the artist know
what he's talking about unless he's lived in it?

Difficult childhoods, agitation, disturbed thoughts, and uncommon life
experiences are also what fuel stand-up comedians for whom reality and society
as given do not give proper venue to adequate expression. How disaffected were
Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, and Sarah Silverman that they could not look at life
without also seeing its magnificent comedy, that which doesn't even cross the
minds of normal people? Such torment is also what strikes a comedian as
intellectual as Stephen Fry. And it is not only creatives who are capable of an
alternate view. Jane Goodall, who never planned on becoming a scientist but
rather thought of herself as an artist who wanted to live among animals in
Africa and write about them, spent who knows how long on her own in the forest,
and she said, "Some people will pick out tiny things as beauty. Other people
won't even notice them. The shape of a wet leaf on the pavement, even in an ugly
place. A footstep on the sand filling up with water. The whole picture you can
get—a child's footprint and a dog's paw, and a tide coming in—can be very
beautiful. Other people might just tramp over them and not see them at all." She
said too, "A simple fly landed on me—this one was shining green and gold, and it
had little specks of red— beautiful fly, bristly fur on its abdomen. And I
looked at it and thought, when a chimpanzee looks at something like this, he
doesn't have the word, the word 'fly'. So he's looking at it as it is. Now I'm
imagining myself being in a situation of not having words, so if I can
categorize it as a fly it takes away from something of the beauty of the
moment—because it's just a 'fly'—so forget 'fly' and look at this being that's
there." How can an artist be a reiteration of the cookie-cutter norm of
conformity? Someone wholesome and functional is amenable and pleasant and may be
unconditionally kind and deserving of kindness in return, yet these traits of
rigid regularity are confining and sterile. Normal people, like anyone, are to
be treated with customary courtesy but it would be a mistake to expect them
to take the artist where he wishes to go. At the end of the day, an
artist can speak his mind only with another artist, and separating him from
everyone else is the unbridgeable gap between forever strangers. This notion is
crucial, especially for the artist, whose value is his vision. The image of the
artist as disturbed, reclusive, tormented, is the right one. Privacy and
seclusion are essential to being oneself. Without his privacy, how could Sacha
Baron Cohen have concocted his social and political vessel to become a
ridiculous buffoon like BORAT? Frances McDormand, who shuns the usual Hollywood
celebrity and lives away from the limelight, unencumbered by maintaining an
image of propriety, not hidden behind seven layers of makeup, not draped in the
season's designer advertisement, could not but be genuine. She lives remotely,
modestly, saying, "I get to live my more authentic self here, and I don't have
to pretend to be anybody else." Why do we suppose hardly anyone has seen Thomas
Pynchon? The idea is the same as when Thoreau sought to confront only "the
essential facts of life." Rousseau wrote REVERIES OF THE SOLITARY WALKER. And do
we fault William Blake for his singular vision? Or Proust who retired from the
world to write his novel, the man who, having lived life, sat down to write
about it? Or Aaron Swartz for abhorring the white noise in the office? Rilke
wrote, "We are solitary. We can delude ourselves about this and act as if it
were not true. That is all. But how much better it is to recognize that we are
alone; yes, even to begin from this realization."

The artist, accustomed to time alone, dedicated to communicating through his
work, does not have the habit of doing so in person. When his interviewer
expressed frustration at eliciting a response, Coetzee said, "The questions you
have posed to me are, many of them, difficult questions, and it's my habit of
mind to reflect and revise and try to attain a certain completion and perfection
in my responses, and that is incompatible with the interview medium. That's why
I've been so extremely uncomfortable." Coetzee belongs to the category of
artists who are not outwardly striking but instead modest and unassuming, who
live largely uneventful lives outside of their work, as do I. I do believe that
I speak for the artists in this category when I say our ideas come not from
outside but from within, and any perturbance on our part only distracts us from
seeing the vision. A painter expressed my experience of artistic creation when
he said, "I wait till the inner lights to go on. The inner light means it's the
moment I start to paint. If the inner light goes on in me I start right away to
paint, everything is there, the paint, the canvas. And I paint till the end, but
there's no end. I live in a lawless world. There is no law. The end is spiritual
orgasm . . . You have to sit and wait until the inner light goes on.  It is only
by sitting and waiting, if you wait for the inner lights to go on, then you can
talk. Now I have contact with the planet, the surroundings. It has nothing to do
with logical or practical things. Speaking like practical, logical,
philosophical people is not the real way. It is the wrong way. Clever, handy,
routine is the wrong way. You have sit and wait until the inner lights go on in
you and then we can talk." I don't think myself a kind person, or particularly
humble, try as I may. When the moment strikes, I sit quietly and write wherever
I happen to be, and the affair is entirely without spectacle. To watch me
writing would be beside the point. It is entirely a solitary process and not one
worth witnessing. What matters is what comes out as a result of subsuming all
senses, imagination, experience, sentiment, an eye attentive to life, trusting
an unwavering taste to channel what is worth writing into the written word. It
would not be productive to ask me how I wrote it either because  I myself do not
know. Csikszentmihalyi called this experience "flow", but there's a distinction
to be made between the rational and the creative processes. The throes of
engagement when writing a computer program does not feel the same as the chaos
and darkness of writing prose that's at risk of slipping away. I can write
comments about what I wish to code and come back later; I don't have that luxury
with prose that runs dry when I've lost how I wanted to write it. The ideas I
hear from the inner voice in the passing moments that I deem worth writing are
not easily reproducible and only seem they can after the fact because they sit
on the page, outside my head. When I finish a coding session I emerge with a
sense of completion in the head, the kind of lifeless, fading satisfaction that
comes with overcoming an intellectual puzzle. But with prose, after long hours
swimming in the night ocean, the weary soul attains a deep satiety that isn't
quite joy so much as a sense of meaning from having danced with life.

Elon Musk was right when he said that companies should "spend less time on
finance, spend less time in conference rooms, less time on PowerPoint and more
time just trying to make [their] product as amazing as possible." But he stops
short of the reason those in management refuse to do the obvious and innovate.
He is asking MBAs, whose primary value proposition is to stand before an
audience and sell fancy numbers tacked onto colorful pictures, to use skillsets
they don't have and be engineers and designers, thinkers and experimentalists,
to give themselves over to late nights in the office, putting off family duties,
placing the product above themselves. Erving Goffman called it "body glossing"
when someone explicitly signals to others his activity that is otherwise
indiscernible—checking our phone as we wait in a lobby to inform passersby that
we're waiting for someone. When an MBA stands in front of a slide deck, the
entire body is glossing. Title and formality, power and position, capital and
distance secure a comfort that resists change and new ideas. Who doesn't want to
be a visionary? But what does it cost? The flip side of this coin is that it is
unreasonable to expect everyone to be a relentless innovator. Whether it is the
changing priorities in life as we age, our divergent aspirations due to
different backgrounds, our accustomed privilege, one cannot expect the bulk of
the workforce to demand on themselves a rocketship's takeoff protracted to a
lifetime, exhilarating and glorious but also consuming and precarious.
Innovators, radicals, and progressives are and will continue to remain a faint
portion of society, loud and inspiring but few and precious. Most of us, indeed,
are content being normal: a job is just a job. How dispiriting! and yet how true
to human nature! and I too shall one day fall in place! A voice in me bares
itself and screams: Have you sailed the seven seas, summited K2's peak, unveiled
the secrets of humanity, pried into the mysteries of the universe, have you
become all that which you aspired to be, have you pushed the boulder up the
mountain enough times, have you seen the apocalypse and returned to live your
days knowing you've reached the end, that there was no more, have you tapped
into the wavelength of what it means to be alive, a fragile collection of
stardust that wonders its place among the stars? Writing's music cannot express
convulsive pangs as purely as music in the plain, heard over shut eyes—I am
reminded of Michael Nyman's TIME LAPSE. And so too I am reminded of Hesse:
"Eternity is a mere moment, just long enough for a joke."

<h4>2021-02-20, 六. How it Ends and Elsewhere Begins Anew.</h4>
A daughter returns to Greece with her father who was born there. He is returning
to exhume his mother. The country's shortage of burial space means the dead lie
in rented land, staying for three years before their family must come to
retrieve their bones to make room for someone else. The uncle hadn't left the
small town with the father decades ago and is the one digging. He clears away
the soil, pulling up bits of coffin and bone. The Greeks bury their dead facing
west, where the sun sets and where life ends. The daughter is next to her
father. First comes the skull with the hair still brown. Then a shoulder bone, a
clavicle, and some ribs. The daughter takes a second to look at her father and
then back to her uncle. More bones come up, and he reaches a femur and the feet.
The uncle steps out. He and the father put the pieces together with their hands.
When they are done, the daughter looks at her father who is looking at his
mother assembled on the ground. The daughter feels guilty when the thought
occurs to her that she might one day stand where her father is. The thought
lingers for a second before she glances at the ground and thinks, that's where
life once was. Only the three of them are present, and the ceremony has no music
or fanfare. Her father will box his mother's remains and bring them to a room
that also houses others she'd grown up with. A gentle breeze in the air. The
daughter knows that when she returns to work next week, she will have to rejoin
her colleagues in the usual office banter. The sun is heavy this afternoon but
she knows too the sun does not shine for her.

<h4>2021-02-11, 四. On Race, Diversity, and Immigration.</h4>
Today's post is delicate for obvious reasons. Reader be warned, this may make
you more uncomfortable than my other posts, but this is an important issue to
explore.<br>
___

Let's cast aside the political polarization for a moment and have a mature
conversation on race and the future identity of America. It's not popular these
days but I don't think it's inherently racist to talk about race and its
practical consequences, from both perspectives: the white's and the person of
color's. There are very real issues that have to be addressed. The recent rise
of neo-Nazies, conspiracy theories, and white supremacism is not possible under
a well-functioning democracy. It only happens when people are insecure and under
threat, and this threat stems from 1) poor white folks who feel the country has
forgotten them and 2) the rapid demographic changes are altering the country's
identity. I have nothing insightful to say about the first reason on top of the
obvious need to address the problem. This post addresses the second reason.

<b>Discontent</b>

Here are the facts.
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/03/14/the-us-will-become-minority-white-in-2045-census-projects/">Estimates</a>
project that the country will become majority non-white in 2045. It's very soon—
I'll likely still be alive when it happens. What do whites, who are losing
representation, think of this? A
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/03/21/views-of-demographic-changes-in-america/">survey</a>
found nearly as many view it positively (26%) as negatively (28%).

I'd like to first write a bit with the 28% in mind. At the extreme is the
far-right. Richard Spencer, Lauren Southern, and Gavin McInnes are saying, "We
built the wealthiest nation on Earth, we introduced democracy and defended it,
we created a free state for all, we created the modern world, and who are these
foreigners coming over and stealing our inheritance from us?" This is indeed the
reality, and I have to say, they have a point. There's a conversation to be had,
certainly not one I can settle but let's examine this further. My view in the
end is that resources, opportunities, and equitable values should not be hoarded
within lines as arbitrary as race.

It's worth repeating: I don't think it's racist to talk about whites wishing to
preserve Western civilization. It's a matter of defensive self-conservation. The
far right is the loudest but in today's intolerance that's the only venue to
voice this defensive stance. Again I don't think this is racist but their
concern is they're being pushed out. I read this from somewhere online—to my
fellow liberals, this might be useful to see where the right is coming
from—consider a white person moving to China and demanding that Chinese culture
be moved aside, that the Chinese should lose rights for racial equality, and
that the Chinese should be disarmed and have no option to push back. It's not
racist but such actions provoke self-defense even by a neutral bystander. The
question is whether it's fair to believe the dominant culture of the country
(white culture) would be happy becoming just another minority group and losing
the power it's had since the country's inception. I'd like to believe so because
the way forward for the country is to accommodate all Americans but I suspect
many white folks, openly or privately, don't—specifically the 28% in the survey
who didn't even bother pretending. The question isn't about equality. The
country's changing racial demographics is like saying: imagine a Britain that's
not predominantly British or a China that's not predominantly Chinese. And no
matter our skin color, if any of us takes a stroll along the Seine in Paris and
see more Muslims in hijabs than the original French, does Paris feel French?
This is the unsettling reality. Suppose for a moment that we lifted every poor
white American out of poverty and secured their future prospects. Even then,
would they be happy with no longer being able to identify with what the country
is becoming? Conservatives feel their homeland is being hijacked even while we
progressives see inequality at every turn. It's a problem in Europe too with the
Syrian refugee crisis. Whiteness, Christianity, and the European identity that
built the country are being threatened and what we're doing is blanket-blocking
any mention of it as racist when there's a valid point here.

This problem extends to academia. A very recent vanguard in the humanities has
essentially been saying: "we" have been oppressed, colonialized,
underrepresented, and now that we're empowered we're going to take what's ours
and air our dirty laundry. I'm not saying their push for equality is wrong but
that they leave no room for the other side in a climate of cancel culture. Think
of all the academics whose entire careers are based on what is now blatantly
called imperialist and colonialist. The premise of the country as a free state
where all are equal is not possible when we are separating ourselves into
piecemeal subcultures defending our turf. America cannot be an either/or but has
to be an inclusive both/and. Among many other adjustments, the required
coursework reading may very well have to change from the exclusively white
Western canon and the field may need some serious reflection on its context and
history, but this doesn't mean dissolving the discipline, as Dan-el Padilla
Peralta is open to doing with the classics. Let's recall that even ideas as
radically departing from traditional Western perspective as those in Edward
Said's ORIENTALISM didn't call for destroying the whole field.

What is happening is human nature: everyone pursues his interest, and it is the
country that plays mediator for all citizens. Can we each stop demonizing the
other side? It is useful to keep in mind John Rawls' veil of ignorance and take
a step back from our particular place in society to think larger. With America
soon to become majority non-white, we have to make peace with that fact. Now,
onto something more interesting.

<b>Towards a Brighter Future</b>

This is sobering: a
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376654">study</a>
last year found that when people are forming teams and adding members, they
deliberately reduce diversity when they are shown whether a potential member
boosts or drops the team's overall diversity. This behavior looms large.
For all we tout diversity in our public relations messaging, for all the
apparent diversity in cities, residential neighborhoods are largely segregated
by race, even in our most diverse cities:

shows the race distribution in the country using the 2010 census data, with one
dot per person, each dot colored by race. This is the undeniable state of
affairs: de facto segregation. Residential segregation translates to school
segregation.
<a href="https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/30098/why-have-americas-public-schools-gotten-more-racially-segregated">These</a>
maps show segregation consistent with the country's racialized geography, and
this is over half a century after <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.
Whatever image of a racially integrated country we may have in mind is not just
overly optimistic but entirely wrong. PRRI
<a href="https://www.prri.org/research/poll-race-religion-politics-americans-social-networks/">surveyed</a>
racial compositions in 2013 of social networks within racial groups and
revealed shocking homogenity. Among whites, 91% of friends are also white,
among Blacks, 83% are Black, and among Hispanics, 64% are Hispanic. And Asians?
No data for us. We're invisible. But these numbers remind me of Beverly
Daniel Tatum's WHY ARE ALL THE BLACK KIDS SITTING TOGETHER? because of its
title and how it cuts at the core of the matter. What is disheartening is I have
not even the slightest instinct to say these numbers are out of touch with
reality. What about the entertainment we consume? A
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/61/2/369/4098571">study</a>
found "[w]hite participants showed significantly less interest in seeing movies
with mostly Black casts than in seeing movies with mostly [w]hite casts."
Another
<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1996-05-02-1996123149-story.html">study</a>
found that whites and Blacks have few favorite TV shows in common.
And books? I couldn't find a study on this, but let's be honest. If we can't
even bring ourselves to watch movies and TV across race, how many do we suppose
have read James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, or Toni Morrison? Or Zadie Smith, Salman
Rushdie, Orhan Pamuk?

So we don't live together, don't go to the same schools, aren't friends with
each other, don't watch the same movies or TV shows, and if we meet each other
at work what guides our conversations is a societal restraint from broaching
race that precludes any serious discussion and mingling. How then are we to make
friends across racial lines if we don't have much in common, can't point out the
obvious, and skirt about the issue by talking shop, and when we invite that
friend to our circle of largely homogenous friends we are also transferring the
burden of restraint to them? And what are we talking about when we say with such
conviction that we understand the Black plight or that of other minorities who
have been less abused and less disenfranchised over the course of the country's
history if the immensity of our unquestioned confidence comes from—indeed
betrays—our own realities, our projected mythologies and imaginations exchanged
among friends, cloistered in our communities where everyone looks and thinks
like ourselves?

Racial inequality is something we can't help but pick up on. We adults don't
talk about it because we've learned restraint, afraid of saying the wrong thing,
and instead keep quiet or look away. Kids notice it too but are more open to
speaking their minds. In the podcast NICE WHITE PARENTS, the host Chana
Joffe-Walt describes this kind of situation when white students, who bring more
funding power, started enrolling at a predominantly Black and Hispanic middle
school: "These boys, even at 11 years old, they've absorbed the same messages
that [the school] wasn't so good before. It was a bad school. He and his
friends, they've turned the school around. That's what he's learning." This is
what the boy in question said: "The kids wouldn't pay attention. And they had,
like--got to, like, zone out every little thing. And I bet they learned very
little. And now this generation with us, I think we're doing a lot better. And I
think that we're learning at a much faster pace." This comment isn't racist so
much as it's an innocent observation of a consequence of our education system
and a history of suppression, and what he is saying is something we all notice
when we come across it, but the current political and social climate casts over
us a pall that mutes what we already know as wise silence.

Here I digress to put in a word on immigration. Like any proper New Yorker, I am
a flaming liberal. I support the idea of equal opportunity for all whether in
this country or in any other. In spite of this, I don't think the answer to the
immigration question is to throw open our doors and let everyone in. There is a
limit to how many the country can tolerate without bankrupting the social
system. David Frum
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/david-frum-how-much-immigration-is-too-much/583252/">notes</a>
the practical concerns of immigration, that immigrants cost the
government more than they contribute in taxes. A part of me says this is the
price of an egalitarianism, but this deficit also surfaces a brutal reality. How
can we accommodate indefinitely more immigrants when our country is already
steep in debt and millions of our own, those we look in the eye as our fellow
Americans, are struggling? Frum advocates focusing our immigration policy to
accept highly skilled immigrants—doctors and engineers—who earn their keep and
help the country remain innovative. This, of course, means a continual brain
drain from their home countries, which strangely enough has been found to
increase wages and democratic values back home. I'm not convinced, however, that
losing a nation's best and brightest helps a developing country stand on its own
and catch up rather than merely benefiting indirectly from Western progress. But
this is the price of supplying American innovation, securing American
well-being.

Diversity—why is it so difficult? I'm an atheist, yet I've sat with a Protestant
as he prayed for me, I've linked hands with Catholics saying grace before a
meal, I've attended Mass, I've sat in classes full of Catholics. I've joined the
Muslim retreat at the Blue Mosque as the muezzin called and witnessed the hall's
worshipers kneeling on the floor in prayer. I put on a kippah in Jerusalem and
stood face-to-face with the Wailing Wall. I sat among the local community in
Mumbai at a Hindu engagement ceremony. So what that I'm an atheist? We should
keep in mind that what feels foreign to one is home to another, and it was the
arbitrary slight of chance that we ourselves were not born into another's
community.

Diversity is the country's future, and it is a future when the landscape of
writers and directors will have changed, along with the TV-watching and
movie-going market whose preference commands what the entertainment industry
produces. One day, this era's fight for social justice, equal representation,
true equality under law and its enforcement, will have been but one chapter in
the transition to a more equitable world. And one day, we will not think it out
of the ordinary that a lead actor is brown though we notice it and are aware of
the long struggle that made such casting possible, and we will not be
uncomfortable watching a person of color rejoice or sulk or have the full range
of experiences of any ordinary human. One day, the unsightly practice will have
passed when the camera deigns a moment for the diversity shot and then cuts
away, returning to the default whiteness. The country's future is mixed, and we
have to accept this as a reality, not boil over with veiled resentment.

William Buckley wrote, "A conservative is someone who stands athwart history,
yelling Stop." What nonsense. How shortsighted is his view of history that for
him, history extends no further than the past several hundred years since the
Great Divergence that marked the West's emergence as the world's wealthiest and
most advanced civilization, and he happened to have lived in the period when
such self-flattery is possible. The one constant that endures time is change,
and just as no individual lives forever in his youthful peak, no society is
immune to its evolving fortunes. How many came before who met worse fates have
had to accept change? Russians, Indians, Chinese, Persians, Turks, Aztecs,
Egyptians, and all those who belonged to once thriving civilizations: if it is
any consolation, others have been here before, and the decline of white power
in America is one peaceful tick of change in the ocean of our inflated
self-importance. How many in those prior civilizations screamed that the end is
nigh, yet the world has moved on, and they carry about themselves in it as
routinely as the earth revolves around the sun? It's always irked me how any
mentioning the fall of the Roman Empire carries an air of puritanical
nationalism, that it is with resentful resignation that such greatness came to
an end. It certainly was great, but we give the invaders who brought its fall
the exceedingly flattering name of barbarians even though they too had families
and lives, pursuing their interests just as the Romans theirs, and these
barbaric tribes don't seem barbarians any longer when we name them properly:
the Franks settling in modern France, the Visigoths in modern Spain, the
ancestors of the moderns. We sympathize so intensely with the Romans because we
see only one side, and the fact that we continue to use the word barbarians
descends from this lineage—it's what the Romans called outsiders. It is worth
reminding ourselves the truth Carl Sagan pointed out in COSMOS: "National
boundaries are not evident when we view the earth from space. Fanatical ethnic
or religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain when we
see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous
point of light against the bastion and citadel of the stars." That blue
crescent formed 4,500,000,000 years ago, of which we humans developed
agriculture in the last 12,000 and began laying the foundation for
civilization. It is outright foolish to think that human culture has peaked and
should change no further. The future of the country is diversity and what must
happen: acceptance and unity, not separation and exclusion. Why not imagine a
future where we contain Whitman's multitudes? Across canyons and valleys, lush
green praries and eroded rock strewn over sand-blown desert, towering mesas and
redwood forests, we find small towns and major metropolises decorating the land
under the snow-capped mountains, for we are all of us American: brown and
yellow and black and white and blue and red, bound not by prescriptions of the
isolated echo chambers that came before but by a full forward march, hand in
hand, towards a history that will bear our names in pioneering pride. When we
were children we saw ourselves as adventurers and explorers, looking out at a
world full of mystery, curious at everything, unafraid to learn, elated to be
alive. Where has that sense of awe and wonder gone?

<h4>2021-02-09, 二. In Defense of Abstract Art.</h4>
Why view abstract art? When we stand before an abstract painting, what is it
that we're looking at in the indeterminate swirls that don't even remotely
resemble a person, a place, or anything familiar? I wish to address why I prefer
abstraction.

If we can represent nature by reducing it into a set of equations, why not too
visual expression into art's purest form? And what is visual art on the canvas
but the strokes of a brush painting in the four variables of color, shape, size,
and space? Consider Mondrian, Rothko, and Kandinsky. They use these variables to
their own vision, and even with such a small arsenal, how can we say their
compositions are anything but wholly unlike each other? It is often mentioned
that abstract paintings lack technical difficulty. To this I say that the
difficulty of abstraction is in the conception which requires a certain
maturity, not in the elitist sense, but in the capacity to grasp symbolism to
its devastating potential. One way to conceive of the world is to view nature
and the universe as the eternal constants in which we measly humans flicker by,
but another, equally valid one is to place ourselves at the central vantage
point because what will it all have mattered if we don't exist? To appreciate
abstraction is to take the leap from merely mimicking reality, scrupulously
copying down its concretized distinctions and its various shades of light, to
human expression, the crux of what it means to be alive.

I remember the first time I encountered Barnett Newman's VIR HEROICUS SUBLIMIS.
I was pulled to it as if by a magnet, drawn up close to the life-sized red
canvas, the red consuming my entire field of vision, and I felt shivers running
down my spine. Staring straight ahead, I felt transported to another realm, and
what ran through me for a full minute was a whole world of sensory saturation.
The canvas encased all passion, all desire, all rage, all triumph, and it was
surging excitement, jubilation: the sublime. What I felt was nothing less than
the chaos of the universe, human folly, birth and death, our meaningless
motions, coming together in a form so simple. It is an overflowing power even
though the painting does not laboriously enumerate all human mistakes under the
sky, it does not have any semblance of a character or story, it doesn't have any
material substance other than color and size, for this impalpability mirrors
what we have in the end: nothing. And this sensory experience is the meaning of
the work, needing no other indication than the title: Man Heroic Sublime. Some
attempt to approach the painting using traditional methods, examining its
construction and the artist's background. To do so is to have missed the point.
They place undue emphasis on the vertical lines, the zips, and deconstruct the
order in which Newman painted them—it's a rather simple exercise of withholding
some vertical space with tape and then either painting between a pair or
painting around one. But this is not the right way to look at the painting, and
we do not understand the painting through its technicalities any more than we
get closer to understanding what enables life by analyzing the brain's atomic
makeup. The zips merely serve to provide a sense of size for a painting that
stands taller than any viewer.

I am not suggesting that expression and meaning is limited to abstraction's
dominion. Consider Norman Rockwell's undeniably political THE PROBLEM WE ALL
LIVE WITH, or Caspar David Friedrich's proud WANDERER ABOVE THE SEA OF FOG, or
Giorgio de Chirico's dreary THE MELANCHOLY OF DEPARTURE, or the contrast of
human transience and the mountain's unfazed apathy in Hokusai's EJIRI IN THE
SURUGA. Let's not forget Yayoi Kusama's more visceral infinity mirror
installations that manifest her internal world, rife with obsessions, a black
room illuminated by floating lights all around, all receding into the horizon, a
world on fire from which there is no escape, a world into which the public
voluntarily steps. Or the same concept rendered more explicit in Edvard Munch's
THE SCREAM, which unlike the former cannot be misinterpreted as just a pretty
picture. What I am saying is abstraction's poignance arises from its simplicity
that is too often overlooked, a simplicity that not only enhances a painting's
lyric capacity but elevates the art by inflecting upon its very medium so that
the artist, the process, the art meld into one. Why should a Ronnie Landfield
stare at us less directly and speak to us from further away than Vermeer's GIRL
WITH A PEARL EARRING? In one brush stroke dashing across the surface, one color
reaching upwards, dancing among many in our human dynamism, we see not a
landscape or a portrait but a visual ode singing the tune of our inner
complexity.

To stay clear of art's mystique, I must mention the regrettable reality is that
any mention of art is preceded by its reputation. In this sense, art is like
wine tasting. Wine tasting and, even more importantly, the acquired diction
developed to describe it unfortunately connote class aspiration, class
maintenance, and the whole system of media that reinforce wine's continued
esteem and consumption. We don't dwell a second on wine's unfermented cousin,
the unremarkable grape juice, but we go to considerable lengths to distinguish
between wines by variety, region, year, and color. Though we may sensibly
separate a heavy malbec from a mild pinot noir, when we start throwing around
phrases like "flavor of blackberry", "notes of earthy vanilla", "hints of
seasoned red plum", and "a rich dark chocolate lingering in the aftertaste",
all the while affecting a poker face as we swirl and sniff ourselves into high
oblivion, should we not ask ourselves if there might not be a more productive
use of time than making an impression? Any genuine appreciation for wine is
quickly extinguished when artifice enters the conversation. So too is art when
we chase the big name, attach a price tag, and enshroud it in undue mystery.
The art market has not escaped the American variety of ruthless capitalism, and
decades of rising economic inequality has permitted the rise of rogue
billionaires who patronize rogue artists like Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons. Why
do some artists fetch handsome sums at Christie's or Sotheby's while many of
their peers struggle, forced to sell their work on the street? There is a
market whose taste is determined by an exclusive community, and the clients,
keen on entertaining guests of similar standing, viewing a painting as an
investment, patting themselves on the back for procuring a rarefied treasure
for the spouse, transact in prestige which, too, can be bought. The truth is
that the CEOs, the hedge fund managers, and those in the professional class
whose wealth has passed the threshold where capital allocation alone suffices
for comfortable living have not, over the course of their upward career
trajectory, had the time to calibrate artistic taste. The real artist,
dedicated to his craft as a parent to a child, for whom art is a means of
living, is at the mercy of the tastemakers, the curators, the established
critics. Such is the art market. But American capitalism, ever eager to place
its hand on every exchange, bends the market to its own morality. This is not
art for art's sake but raw capitalism. Let us appreciate art on its own accord,
art for all. As Jerry Saltz says, anyone can look at art—including abstract
art.

<h4>2019-10-19, 六. On Humility.</h4>
I came across some old archives from my college. In them, photos—I'll provide
the links at the end of this entry, but it is my hope that the reader resist
the itch to scroll down. The plague of modernity, fragmented, interrupting,
dispersed across screens, paper, devices, copies and versions, scrambled notes
and secluded apps, cross-referencing links, bold images and billboard pizzazz,
chaos and dementia all vying for attention, is not the lack of information but
the senseless deluge of it. In these old archives, photos: a past era spread
across decades, from the early to late 1900s. The exact dates, just one window
among many, are not important. Age is apparent in the photos: black-and-white,
the box desktop monitor, the oversized eyeglasses common in a bygone era. An
image of the building facade I know so well, that entrance colonnade, the
familiar study rooms and library stacks, the exposed brick in the background
whose texture I can still feel on my fingertips, whose varying shades of deep
tan at the front of a lecture hall I can still see from the back row. Photos of
students and professors, angled over a book, gesturing against a blackboard, a
chin resting on a palm. These are images of contemplation. I see my former
professor too; he is young, the dawn of the present's grey hair still on the
unforeseeable horizon, and I am reminded of his soft-spoken, deliberate words,
his liberal smiles. Here in these images is an ethos, a generation that has had
its day. I ask: where has the time gone? A day will come when my own present,
captured in its 4K ultra-high definition, its 60 FPS videos, its surround
sound, will seem the same way the image my former professor does to me.

Why am I consistently struck by images like these? They check me and my
obsessions, my principles and remorseless ventures, my defiances and rages, my
deep subversion and antipathy, my irreverence and disregard, my high
expectation, my absurdism  which proclaims with all its bared conviction the
active pursuit of personal meaning, hinged on individualism and suffering. Who
can't revel when resources abound, when surplus is assured? Who can't lounge at
the resort, the tropical vacation, under the canopy of a beach umbrella? How
can you measure a man's worth without plunging him into confusion, without
testing his willpower, without questioning his premises, without first casting
him into continual self-doubt, without subjecting him to arduous probing,
without seeing what comes of him at the end, without the final analysis? How
can you understand him if you only broach the surface? Does not our brittle
sentience oblige us to something higher? Begin thus: shut the eyes, lock the
world out, and create your own. There is naive happiness: contagiously
distracting, wholly irrelevant, easy happiness. And yet is joy and elation not
written in the eyes in those photos, snapshots of once-luminous years now laid
to rest, encrusted in digitized stone? What justifies this morbid
preoccupation, this pathological vexation? Who wanders on the distant shore?
There is immortality, transcendence, a surge for meaning, the soaring spirit,
and what but a mere few decades collapses a firestorm into flickering vestiges,
a reality no longer ignorable, a whirling intensity and dire flame abated by
universal inevitability? Push enough in one direction, and the path converges
on the other end, the whole ordeal turning out to be nothing more than a simple
circle. Is not man waking contradiction, lucid paradox? What lies in the
periphery erodes, our own constructions crumbling away when we, at our silent,
inconsequential ends, rejoin the dust clouds. I remember the broad strokes of
an algorithm book's preface I chanced upon some years ago, encapsulated in
these words: "We are all born into this world grasping for comprehension. We
leave it in much the same way." As I gaze at these photos and am forced to
confront the fate of our collective humanity, I cave in to the flash of
overwhelming sympathy, inspired to the depths towards pure union, and am
convinced that this is the veritable truth, but do I not soon regain the call
to existence? Am I not at every moment of ease restless? And when among friends
at an evening gathering, among companions enjoying company, am I not suspicious
of communal comfort, and am I not asking myself whether I shouldn't be doing
something productive? Perhaps I do not see past youthful illusion, and I remain
the perpetual sourpuss, the unyielding killjoy. Perhaps the matter of fact is
this habit of mine is needless exertion, because—you, me, and everyone
else—we're all just wasting time. A part of me, down to its very blood and
bones, its beating heart and spiritual core, longs for transcendence. Another,
which surfaces infrequently, and always with cataclysmic delirium, crumbles
down to earth, groveling on its knees, defeated and repenting. In me are
disjoint visions, distal opposites, a fervent intensity which hardly anyone can
detect beneath a serene appearance and pliable demeanor, much less for a people
known far more for amenability than audacity, the orient's deep-rooted harmony,
because the strength of the outward thrust is paired with a stronger restraint,
dimpled by over-sensitive nerves quickly overwhelmed from multiple commotion.

I had come across the archive photos a while ago but was reminded of them after
I was, in the unpredicatable network of the internet, linked to the late Jack
Schwartz's In Memoriam site. Browsing the photos, I felt grounded, anchored.
The fact that the camera is not as sharp as contemporary ones dates the photos,
contextualizing them. Though I never met Jack, I saw in these images a life in
retrospect, countries I've also visited, travels I can relate to, and which, as
they appear in those images, seem to belong to Jack's time. To linger over the
past is an undiluted view—somber, yes—but it is a fate which not too far in the
future will be our own and which should evoke in us not only relation to
another time and how we are situated against it, but also emphasize what is at
stake when we live ours. The greatest divides are the boundaries across
generations, life experience locked away in the written word or the still
photograph.

<h4>2019-09-30, 一. Towards Mundanity.</h4>
It seems to me that there is a misplaced importance in the glittery and special,
the infrequent and towering. Consider for a minute what we deem noteworthy, the
occasions, the people, the excursions we wish to record in some form so we may
later remember the original instance. Imagine what tempts us to take a photo:
family reunions, smiles at the museum next to Starry Night, a friend's birthday
party, a beached whale, scuba diving in the lagoon, gazing outwards at the
dappled skyscraper lights in the twilight cityscape from the top of the Empire
State Building. Imagine what we write about: intrigue, mystery, cataclysm,
swashbuckling drama, romance, adventure, fantasy, conjured fiction. The objects
and events which attract our remembrances are not those that embody our lived
experience which bears the bulk of our hours and days but which are instead the
rogue anomalies, sparkling and fanciful yet sparse and detached, unrealistic
and unrepresentative. Why is it that we pay almost exclusive attention to those
infrequent moments and overlook what occupies the bulk of our daily lives, the
very things that go unnoticed for the simple fact that the evening commute, the
season's pantry selections, the foible during Wednesday's thunderstorm, the
arrangement of books, papers, furnishings in the apartment, the brittle morning
quietude, are common and invariant? These elements of our present context, the
details of our facticity, should be cherished and appreciated precisely because
we tend not to see them, and we cannot see their value when we've acclimated to
the certainty of their presence in the periphery because they acquire contrast
and nostalgic meaning only in the years afterwards when the familiarity and
habituated motions we had once taken for granted which had, without thought,
colored our backgrounds are no longer accessible beyond vague and, by then,
certainly distorted memory, in those moments when we long that time also flows
backwards.

To each his own chosen delights and dissipation. What is revolting is when
natural complexity is buried by a pacifying smile which disregards and
invalidates these indispensible considerations, banishing them to nonexistence.
Mundane and common, yes, though nothing less than an appetite for the taste of
existence, melancholic and transient.

<br>

<h4>2019-09-29, 日.</h4>
There is a pond outside, wavelings rippling across the surface, a soft, gentle,
constant wind billowing over its still mass. Two adolescent geese are floating
near the edge, wings folded, necks tall and curved like cranes, feathered
chests thrust out like a hen sitting on her eggs, enticing to the hands like a
pomeranian's coat. It is a cloudy afternoon, a uniform grey pall, bleak and
gloom looming in the skies above, time seemingly halted, the movements of the
guiding lights in abeyance, left without an announcement when late afternoon
becomes early evening. Perhaps it is the changing of the seasons. A mild chill
this morning, headwind of the winter ahead.

<br>

<h4>2019-09-28, 六.</h4>
I am sitting in the driver's seat. My mind is frazzled, in disarray, inklings of
flickering thoughts branching in remorseless rampance, so many, so variable,
too disorganized to pursue. A sense of loss. I am driving down Douglas Road,
stuck in unusual traffic, behind an SUV stopped by a red light. I pause, shut
my eyes, take advantage of the sterile moment, hoping to quell my racing
thoughts again, this time once and for all. I had been catching up with myself
all day, tracing the lingering images, inspirations, encounters of the week
which had not yet been given due time, the weekend a reprieve from the
barbarous class schedule, being tossed between buildings and classrooms,
littered with hectic meetings, to-do lists, chaos, fragmented attention. And I
had been telling myself that even on the weekend I shouldn't lapse into rest,
letting myself loosen up and breathe, that instead I should be working. I am,
after all, in graduate school. Isn't that what I moved here for, the busyness,
the urgently packed miscellanea of academic life, a new start? When the SUV
starts moving, I realize why the road is crowded: it must be football weekend.
I am on my way to J's dinner which the day before I resolved not to attend,
then considered, re-considered, settled, uprooted, a whole series of
vacillations so typical of my character, demanding routine and predictability
yet given to sudden whims and unexpected routs. My thoughts are unstable, and I
am weary from the day's brooding and pacing, the torrent unleashed by the
weekend's dam opening the floodgates of accumulated mental weight, and pursuing
each trace is tiring, a private preoccupation, the weekend in the apartment a
furnace of dilemma and quandary, sinking into contemplation after which there
is no concretized proof of progress but which leaves me relieved and in touch
with myself, a weekly rite of passage. I fret at a question that seems to come
easily to others and which is answered just as readily, in what to them is a
natural wave of the hand and which has never occurred to me as a simple
inquiry, not because I do not wish to reply, but simply because I do not know
how to answer in a way that satisfies me, much less in the immediacy of casual
small-talk: how was my weekend? What may strike others as unfruitful,
uneventful, wallowing, unhealthy, and invented difficulty are what permeate the
time I have on my own, my home life, which is difficult not only because it
does not lend itself to communication and relatability, but also because it is
ethereal, lost even to myself unless I write these ruminations down. This is, I
suppose, what defines my home life, my little adventures: unpalatable
difficulty. But isn't this my default state? To step outside and mingle is
easy, comforting, relaxing, but I cannot help but be wary of its draws towards
complacence, deceptive alleviation, able to stroll in contentment for it has
side-stepped the obligatory uncertainty which, without the forces of disguising
compliance, lies in the plain. Plagued by unfinished strands of thought, an
octopus' arms flailing about, unbeknownst to anyone as always behind my serene
demeanor, I had forced myself to step out the apartment for dinner. I am
driving down a road, half-baked in the head, half-delirious, precarious in my
habits, not fully re-integrated with reality which I usually re-encounter on
Monday but which I can cope with because I know it in advance as a matter of
weekly routine. The laws of nature are difficult, but so is the human psyche.
If this private, continual journey delves further and further inwards, it is in
pursuit of eventual self-discovery. We are each of us, if given proper
consideration, our own worlds waiting to be unveiled.

I'm not the only one buying them after all<br>
none left at my supplier<br>
my bagels ran out last night<br>

<h4>2019-09-23, 一. Excerpt from the little black book.</h4>
Even the presence of company somehow siphons my energy. How can this be? It is
enervating, debilitating, constraining, as if my creative latitude has
contracted, my exploratory freedom diminished. A sense of companionship gives
me at once the comfort of belonging to a group but also a group's conforming
tendencies and impulses in which my instincts are muted, not permitted to
stretch. The conversations that come closest to satisfaction are with only one
other, when I can probe deeply, one-on-one, free from a group's desultory whims
and intrusive, distracting, irrelevant itches and bouts, the inevitable
trajectory of any social engagement, yet as I am walking to class with J, as I
am sitting beside her in the lecture hall, I feel unable to be fully myself, to
linger on my doubts and uncertainties, instead irremediably exuding a calm
masquerade, putting off equanimity and poise, obeying societal prodding due to
internal proclivities I've come to realize have not entirely eroded during the
course of my asocial years but which have been lying dormant and are
resurfacing beyond my will, when the state  of affairs is that I am turbulent,
restless, excitable, and in dire need of the independence availed by solitary
work. After an accompanied episode, I have not only phased out of touch with my
internal state, having lost track of my private compass, having left my
cloistered ecosystem unattended for an interrupting duration, a black chasm
gapingly torn open, almost an unknown void between the moment I was last aware
of myself and my present disorientation, whose back-filling demands
recalibration and reflection, but I am also fatigued, aghast that my redoubled
effort at socialization competes with my very nature.

I like firm showerheads with delightful pressure, no-sugar-added cheesecake,
unscented handsoap, pens that don't smear my hand's belly as it slides across
the page, pleasant saxophonists lighting up the subway with jazzy melodies,
dark humor, deep conversation, lightweight banter, naughter sarcasm, vulnerable
confessions, playful teasing, spending time sharing strange stories, mistakes
made, lingering and unresolved grievances, revealing and then laughing,
remaining sincere and faithful to the layered nuances of living, breathing, and
feeling.

I've been told on multiple occasions I look like a student. People notice it,
though it's not true. It seems that I give off the impression that I'm younger
than my years. Recently at the post office I was asked, by a cashier with
greying hair and a suspicious hesitation gleaming from his eyes, how old I was.
Sometimes the waitress at the bar cards me, because my charming youth unsettles
even the general appearance of maturity from amongst a group of exclusively
older friends, none of them less than half a decade my senior, who had all
already ordered and all without provoking the matron's protective instinct. I
was once reading diligently in the park when a woman, despite my ostensibly
studious posture nonetheless insisted on striking up a conversation, promptly
asked whether I'm a high school student, and I later had to convince myself
that it was not my choice of reading, whose cover was conveniently hidden in
its seated prostration on my lap, but whose hefty size could only have
indicated otherwise, that suggested the question. Also in recent memory is a
treasure hunt for the UPS drop box at the Presbyterian Hospital on 68th, the
sole option at that time in the evening still open for services that was also
reasonably close by, when I, in my youthful impatience, could not wait until
the following day to ship a package. It seems those hospital folk don't ship
packages often because their directions to some secluded hallway in the
basement must've been rooted in that UPS drop box's heydays when it was
formerly in demand, because it has since moved, and the basement folk, who
must've been informed of the move of such a promising and cherished protégé
which had proven, in time's merciless onslaught, to not live up to anticipated
popularity and had now been cast away in disappointment to some back corner,
pointed to the nearby stairs back up to the first floor, across the corridor,
down another hallway, and, in the course of navigating so ingeniously designed
a hospital, I passed the entrance lobby from which I arrived, coming full
circle, realizing that the two directions were hopelessly misaligned, and in
the ensuing flurry in search of the holy land, the secret sanctum, the yogi's
peace, nirvana in a box, it slowly dawned on me that, really, no one knew where
the UPS drop-off was. Or, perhaps more accurately, they were simply directing
this little, uncomprehending youth in meandering circles, round and about,
until he gave up on his own accord, the hospital masterminds acting as one,
collectively and telepathically amusing themselves with their devious tricks
and medical humor, because who but a malicious miscreant with hidden motives
shows up at the hospital so late at night and with nothing better to do than to
drop off a dainty cardboard box— who knows what's in there and what he plans to
do? Long story short, the UPS box is indeed in the basement, but cloistered at
the flank of the cafeteria known as the Garden Cafe—maybe the eponymous garden
is no measly, nameless garden of harmless shrubs and idle tulips, but rather a
minefield of treacherous strife, a religious rite of passage, the Garden of
Eden lost, corrupted, blighted, and man, searching for his return to bliss,
must navigate its deadly swamps under the guise of heartwarming food that lull
the senses with its lunchtime decor. I stood by the doors at the cafe's
entrance, evaluating the danger, thinking, this garden must be the last
obstacle, the final precipice, the most trying test. Needless to say, this is
where many a sailor who, weary and exhausted from sailing the unforgiving high
seas, the mind-bogging and labyrinthine hospital, content themselves with an
easy, filling meal, call it a day, and turn their backs on their original noble
mission. But not this seasoned sailor. To reach the fabled treasure trove, I
bolted into a Rocky-dash up a flight of stairs with exactly four steps,
pummeled past twin doors with no comforting EXIT sign in red neon above—there's
no exit in this one—actually there might have been but at that moment I was at
the height of my powers, a car on seventh gear, too focused to divert my
attention on anything but the end goal, so let's go with the story—and, as if
by intuited scent, made an immediate sharp left, and there it was: the storied
UPS box, hugging the wall, next to its second cousin the Fedex box, in a messy
bed of cardboard dangling on the floor. I found myself in the middle of a dimly
lit hall, and I glanced quickly both ways, left then right, then left again to
eye my proper reward, the haloed UPS offshoot, and I saw in this hall a ghostly
post-apocalyptic world just a door beyond, as silent and harrowing as the two
abandoned blue-leathered stretchers standing in the background, with only each
other for company in their dilapidated, forgotten, eternal melancholy, an early
image of the end to come. Anyways, back to the reason I brought this story up:
one of the security guards I inquired on my adventure was a young lass, late
twenties at most, who at the end of our encounter made a note of appending the
endearing label of "darling" to "have a good evening", the sort of diminutive
affection that one adult would not share with another, particularly with a
stranger, particularly from a lady when the stranger is a grown man, but only
with someone deemed juvenile and adolescent, and I, walking away, wondered if
it was my demure, solicitous earnesty that reminded her of a child holding out
his hands, pleading for his allowance, and provoked her to reveal, as she saw
it, the state of affairs. I deserve the credit of my years! I've weathered a
quarter of a century! That's hard work!

In my field, there's a concentration of analytical, rational, and fiercely
logical types, which I supposes in only fitting, considering this line of work,
and though I can spar toe-to-toe with my coworkers, I frequently find myself
left unsatisfied with the interactions, that though tasks a, b, and c may be
completed double-quick, I have a lingering malaise nudging at my insides, as if
I'm missing something I can't exactly pinpoint, as if moving rapidly through
to-do lists and completing the day's tasks is not quite enough. So while my
colleagues may no sooner remove the last item off their stack than they fling
themselves wholly to another concrete pursuit, I am almost always dawdling
behind, wondering in a trance about this strange incompleteness and, in brief
intervals, why I feel this way. I've grown fairly accustomed to this feeling by
now, and I think I know the reason: deep down I have a yearning that life is
not simply a procession of successive objectives, bullet points, and graspable
actions, because there's a greater satisfaction in touching a dimension beyond
the fabric of physical existence. I get this feeling sometimes too at the movie
theatre when the credits roll, and you hear the sound of those cinema seats
springing back to their upright positions, the audience emptying out, and I
remain seated, gazing at the twilight finale. I used to get it too in school,
when class ends and everyone is rushing to depart, and I'd think, isn't it a
wonder that just a minute ago the room was filled with eager youth, that only a
moment's passing as quick as the flip of a coin can so transform a room from
brimming, untamable energy to nostalgic quietude, that even now the chairs are
still warm. I don't think many of my colleagues will appreciate one of my
strange ruminations—listen: water droplets at the faucet are slowly dripping
into the wash basin!

Maybe I'm just coming up with excuses for my habitual daydreaming, though I
insist that I have a preoccupation with transcendence. You'll understand if the
following excerpt from Pablo Neruda's CON ELLA (WITH HER) unsuspectingly
disarms you, sends you to the clouds for the brief moments you're reading it,
and you stop in your tracks, seized by its beckoning call:

-In the original Spanish:

Como es duro este tiempo, espérame:<br>
vamos a vivirlo con ganas<br>
Dame tu pequeña mano:<br>
vamos a subir y sufrir<br>
vamos a sentir y saltar

-In English:

This time is difficult. Wait for me.<br>
We will live it out vividly.<br>
Give me your small hand:<br>
we will rise and suffer<br>
we will feel, we will fly
