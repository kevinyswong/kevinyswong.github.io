<h4>2019-10-19, 六. On Humility.</h4>
<p>
I came across some old archives from my college. In them, photos—I'll provide
the links at the end of this entry, but it is my hope that the reader resist
the itch to scroll down. The plague of modernity, fragmented, interrupting,
dispersed across screens, paper, devices, copies and versions, scrambled notes
and secluded apps, cross-referencing links, bold images and billboard pizzazz,
chaos and dementia all vying for attention, is not the lack of information but
the senseless deluge of it. In these old archives, photos: a past era spread across
decades, from the early to late 1900s. The exact dates, just one window among many,
are not important. Age is apparent in the photos: black-and-white, the box desktop
monitor, the oversized eyeglasses common in a bygone era. An image of the building
facade I know so well, that entrance colonnade, the familiar study rooms and
library stacks, the exposed brick in the background whose texture I can still
feel on my fingertips, whose varying shades of deep tan at the front of a
lecture hall I can still see from the back row. Photos of students and professors,
angled over a book, gesturing against a blackboard, a chin resting on a palm. These
are images of contemplation. I see my former professor too; he is young, the dawn
of the present's grey hair still on the unforeseeable horizon, and I am reminded of his
soft-spoken, deliberate words, his liberal smiles. Here in these images is an
ethos, a generation that has had its day. I ask: where has the time gone?
A day will come when my own present, captured in its 4K ultra-high definition,
its 60 FPS videos, its surround sound, will seem the same way the image my
former professor does to me.
</p>

<p>
Why am I consistently struck by images like these? They check me and my
obsessions, my principles and remorseless ventures, my defiances and rages, my
deep subversion and antipathy, my irreverence and disregard, my high
expectation, my absurdism  which proclaims with all its bared conviction the
active pursuit of personal meaning, hinged on individualism and suffering. Who
can't revel when resources abound, when surplus is assured? Who can't lounge
at the resort, the tropical vacation, under the canopy of a beach umbrella? How
can you measure a man's worth without plunging him into confusion, without testing
his willpower, without questioning his premises, without first casting him into
continual self-doubt, without subjecting him to arduous probing, without seeing
what comes of him at the end, without the final analysis? How can you understand
him if you only broach the surface? Does not our brittle sentience oblige us to
something higher? Begin thus: shut the eyes, lock the world out, and create
your own. There is naive happiness: contagiously distracting, wholly irrelevant,
easy happiness. And yet is joy and elation not written in the eyes in those photos,
snapshots of once-luminous years now laid to rest, encrusted in digitized stone?
What justifies this morbid preoccupation, this pathological vexation? Who wanders
on the distant shore? There is immortality, transcendence, a surge for meaning,
the soaring spirit, and what but a mere few decades collapses a firestorm into
flickering vestiges, a reality no longer ignorable, a whirling intensity and dire
flame abated by universal inevitability? Push enough in one direction, and the
path converges on the other end, the whole ordeal turning out to be nothing more
than a simple circle. Is not man waking contradiction, lucid paradox? What lies in
the periphery erodes, our own constructions crumbling away, when we, at our silent,
inconsequential ends, rejoin the dust clouds. I remember the broad strokes of an
algorithm book's preface I chanced upon some years ago, encapsulated in these words:
"We are all born into this world grasping for comprehension. We leave it in much
the same way." As I gaze at these photos and am forced to confront the fate of our
collective humanity, I cave in to the flash of overwhelming sympathy, inspired
to the depths towards pure union, and am convinced that this is the veritable truth,
but do I not soon regain the call to existence? Am I not at every moment of ease
restless? And when among friends at an evening gathering, among companions
enjoying company, am I not suspicious of communal comfort, and am I not asking
myself whether I shouldn't be doing something productive? Perhaps I do not
see past youthful illusion, and I remain the perpetual sourpuss, the unyielding
killjoy. Perhaps the matter of fact is this habit of mine is needless exertion,
because—you, me, and everyone else—we're all just wasting time. A part of me,
down to its very blood and bones, its beating heart and spiritual core, longs
for transcendence. Another, which surfaces infrequently, and always with cataclysmic
delirium, crumbles down to earth, grovelling on its knees, defeated and repenting.
In me are disjoint visions, distal opposites, a fervent intensity which hardly
anyone can detect beneath a serene appearance and pliable demeanor, much less for
a people known far more for amenability than audacity, the orient's deep-rooted
harmony, because the strength of the outward thrust is paired with a stronger
restraint, dimpled by over-sensitive nerves quickly overwhelmed from multiple commotion.

I had come across the archive photos a while ago but was reminded of them after
I was, in the unpredicatable network of the internet, linked to the late
Jack Schwartz's In Memoriam site. Browsing the photos, I felt grounded, anchored.
The fact that the camera is not as sharp as contemporary ones dates the photos,
contextualizing them. Though I never met Jack, I saw in these images a life in
retrospect, countries I've also visited, travels I can relate to, and which,
as they appear in those images, seem to belong to Jack's time. To linger over the
past is an undiluted view—somber, yes—but it is a fate which not too far in the
future will be our own and which should evoke in us not only relation to another
time and how we are situated against it, but also emphasize what is at stake
when we live ours. The greatest divides are the boundaries across generations,
life experience locked away in the written word or the still photograph.

I look up, recontextualizing myself<br>

a blank mind<br>
I’ve lost my place<br>

<h4>2019-09-30, 一. Towards Mundanity.</h4>
<p>
It seems to me that there is a misplaced importance in the glittery and special,
the infrequent and towering. Consider for a minute what we deem noteworthy,
the occasions, the people, the excursions we wish to record in some form so we may
later remember the original instance. Imagine what tempts us to take a photo: family
reunions, smiles at the museum next to Starry Night, a friend's birthday party,
a beached whale, scuba diving in the lagoon, gazing outwards at the dappled skyscraper
lights in the twilight cityscape from top of the Empire State Building. Imagine
what we write about: intrigue, mystery, cataclysm, swashbuckling drama, romance,
adventure, fantasy, conjured fiction. The objects and events which atract our
remembrances are not those that embody our lived experience which bears the bulk
of our hours and days but which are instead the rogue anomalies, sparkling and
fanciful yet sparse and detached, unrealistic and unrepresentative. Why is it
that we pay almost exclusive attention to those infrequent moments and overlook
what occupies the bulk of our daily lives, the very things that go unnoticed
for the simple fact that the evening commute, the season's pantry selections, the
foible during Wednesday's thunderstorm, the arrangement of books, papers, furnishings
in the apartment, the brittle morning quietude, are common and invariant? These
elements of our present context, the details of our facticity, should be cherished
and appreciated precisely because we tend not to see them, and we cannot see their
value when we've acclimated to the certainty of their presence in the periphery
because they acquire contrast and nostalgic meaning only in the years afterwards
when the familiarity we had once taken for granted which had, without thought,
colored our backgrounds and habituated motions are no longer accessible  beyond
vague and, by then, certainly distorted memory, in those moments when we long
that time also flows backwards.
</p>

<p>
To each his own chosen delights and dissipation. What is revolting is when
natural complexity is buried by a pacifying smile which disregards and invalidates
these indispensible considerations, banishing them to nonexistence. Mundane and
common, yes, though nothing more than an appetite for the taste of existence,
melancholic and transient.

There is a pond outside, wavelings rippling across the surface, a soft, gentle,
constant wind billowing over its still mass. Two adolescent geese are floating
near the edge, wings folded, necks tall and curved like cranes, feathered chests
thrust out like a hen sitting on her eggs, enticing to the hands like a
pomeranian's coat. It is a cloudy afternoon, a uniform grey pall, bleak and gloom
looming in the skies above, time seemingly halted, the movements of the guiding
lights in abeyance, left without an announcement when early afternoon
becomes early evening. Perhaps it is the changing of the seasons. A mild chill
this morning, headwind of the winter ahead.

I am sitting in the driver's seat. My mind is frazzled, in disarray, inklings
of flickering thoughts branching in remorseless rampance, so many, so variable,
too disorganized to pursue. A sense of loss. I am driving down Douglas Road,
stuck in unusual traffic, behind an SUV stopped by a red light. I pause, shut
my eyes, take advantage of the sterile moment, hoping to quell my racing thoughts
again, this time once and for all. I had been catching up with myself all day,
tracing the lingering images, inspirations, encounters of the week which had not
yet been given due time, the weekend a reprieve from the barbarous class schedule,
being tossed between buildings and classrooms, littered with hectic meetings, to-do
lists, chaos, fragmented attention. And I had been telling myself that even on the
weekend I shouldn't lapse into rest, letting myself loosen up and breathe, that
instead I should be working. I am, after all, in graduate school. Isn't that what
I moved here for, the busyness, the urgently packed miscellanea of academic life,
a new start? When the SUV starts moving, I realize why the road is crowded: it
must be football weekend. I am on my way to J's dinner which the day before I
resolved not to attend, then considered, re-considered, settled, uprooted, a
whole series of vacillations so typical of my character, demanding routine and
predictability yet given to sudden whims and unexpected routs. My thoughts are
unstable, and I am weary from the day's brooding and pacing, the torrent unleashed
by the weekend's dam opening the floodgates of accumulated mental weight, and
pursuing each trace is tiring, a private preoccupation, the weekend in the
apartment a furnace of dilemma and quandary, sinking into contemplation after
which there is no concretized proof of progress but which leaves me relieved
and in touch with myself, a weekly rite of passage. I fret at a question that
seems to come easily to others and which is answered just as readily, in what
to them is a natural wave of the hand and which has never occurred to me as a
simple inquiry, not because I do not wish to reply, but simply because I do not
know how to answer in a way that satisfies me, much less in the immediacy of
casual small-talk: how was my weekend? What may strike others as unfruitful,
uneventful, wallowing, unhealthy, and invented difficulty are what permeate the
time I have on my own, my home life, which is difficult not only because it
does not lend itself to communication and relability, but also because it is
ethereal, lost even to myself unless I write these ruminations down. This is,
I suppose, what defines my home life, my little adventures: unpalatable difficulty.
But isn't this my default state? To step outside and mingle is easy, comforting,
relaxing, but I cannot help but be wary of its draws towards complacence,
deceptive alleviation, able to stroll in contentment for it has side-stepped the
obligatory uncertainty which, without the forces of disguising compliance, lies
in the plain. Plagued by unfinished strands of thought, an octopus' arms flailing
about, unbeknownst to anyone as always behind my serene demeanor, I had forced
myself to step out the apartment for dinner. I am driving down a road, half-baked
in the head, half-delirious, precarious in my habits, not fully re-integrated
with reality which I usually re-encounter on Monday but which I can cope with
because I know it in advance as a matter of weekly routine. The laws of nature are
difficult, but so is the human psyche. If this private, continual journey delves
further and further inwards, it is in pursuit of eventual self-discovery. We are
each of us, if given proper consideration, our own worlds waiting to be unveiled.

<h4>2019-09-23, 一. Excerpt from the little black book.</h4>
<p>
Even the presence of company somehow siphons my energy. How can this be?
It is enervating, debilitating, constraining, as if my creative latitude has
contracted, my exploratory freedom diminished. A sense of companionship gives me
at once the comfort of belonging to a group but also a group's conforming
tendencies and impulses in which my instincts are muted, not permitted to
stretch. The conversations that come closest to satisfaction are with only one
other, when I can probe deeply, one-on-one, free from a group's desultory
whims and intrusive, distracting, irrelevant itches and bouts, the inevitable
trajectory of any social engagement, yet as I am walking to class with J, as I
am sitting beside her in the lecture hall, I feel unable to be fully myself, to
linger on my doubts and uncertainties, instead irremediably exuding a calm
masquerade, putting off equanimity and poise, obeying societal prodding due to
internal proclivities I've come to realize have not entirely eroded during the
course of my asocial years but which have been lying dormant and are resurfacing
beyond my will, when the state  of affairs is that I am turbulent, restless,
excitable, and in dire need of the independence availed by solitary work. After
an accompanied episode, I have not only phased out of touch with my internal
state, having lost track of my private compass, having left my cloistered
ecosystem unattended for an interrupting duration, a black chasm gapingly torn
open, almost an unknown void between the moment I was last aware of myself and
my present disorientation, whose back-filling demands recallibration and
reflection, but I am also fatigued, aghast that my redoubled effort at
socialization competes with my very nature.
