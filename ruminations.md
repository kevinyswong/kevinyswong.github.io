<p>
  Even the presence of company somehow siphons my energy. How can this be?
It is enervating, debilitating, constraining, as if my creative latitude has
contracted, my exploratory freedom diminished. A sense of companionship gives me
at once the comfort of belonging to a group but also a group's conforming
tendencies and impulses in which my instincts are muted, not permitted to
stretch. The conversations that come closest to satisfaction are with only one
other, when I can probe deeply, one-on-one, free from a group's desultory
whims and intrusive, distracting, irrelevant itches and bouts, the inevitable
trajectory of any social engagement, yet as I am walking to class with J, as I
am sitting beside her in the lecture hall, I feel unable to be fully myself, to
linger on my doubts and uncertainties, instead irremediably exuding a calm
masquerade, putting off equanimity and poise, obeying societal prodding due to
internal proclivities I've come to realize have not entirely eroded during the
course of my asocial years but which have been lying dormant and are resurfacing
beyond my will, when the state  of affairs is that I am turbulent, restless,
excitable, and in dire need of the independence availed by solitary work. After
an accompanied episode, I have not only phased out of touch with my internal
state, having lost track of my private compass, having left my cloistered
ecosystem unattended for an interrupting duration, a black chasm gapingly torn
open, almost an unknown void between the moment I was last aware of myself and
my present disorientation, whose back-filling demands recallibration and
reflection, but I am also fatigued, aghast that my redoubled effort at
socialization competes with my very nature.
