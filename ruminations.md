It seems to me that there is a misplaced importance in the glittery and special,
the infrequent and towering. Consider for a minute what we deem noteworthy,
the occasions, the people, the excursions we wish to record in some form so we may
later remember the original instance. Imagine what tempts us to take a photo: family
reunions, smiles at the museum next to Starry Night, a friend's birthday party,
a beached whale, scuba diving in the lagoon, gazing outwards at the dappled skyscraper
lights in the twilight cityscape from top of the Empire State Building. Imagine
what we write about: intrigue, mystery, cataclysm, swashbuckling drama, romance,
adventure, fantasy, conjured fiction. The objects and events which atract our
remembrances are not those that embody our lived experience which bears the bulk
of our hours and days but which are instead the rogue anomalies, sparkling and
fanciful yet sparse and detached, unrealistic and unrepresentative. Why is it
that we pay almost exclusive attention to those infrequent moments and overlook
what occupies the bulk of our daily lives, the very things that go unnoticed
for the simple fact that the evening commute, the season's pantry selections, the
foible during Wednesday's thunderstorm, the arrangement of books, papers, furnishings
in the apartment, the brittle morning quietude, are common and invariant? These
elements of our present context, the details of our facticity, should be cherished
and appreciated precisely because we tend not to see them, and we cannot see their
value when we've acclimated to the certainty of their presence in the periphery
because they acquire contrast and nostalgic meaning only in the years afterwards
when the familiarity we had once taken for granted which had, without thought,
colored our backgrounds and habituated motions are no longer accessible  beyond
vague and, by then, certainly distorted memory, in those moments when we long
that time also flows backwards.

To each his own chosen delights and dissipation. What is revolting is when
natural complexity is buried by a pacifying smile which disregards and invalidates
these indispensible considerations, banishing them to nonexistence. Mundane and
common, yes, though nothing more than an appetite for the taste of existence,
melancholic and transient.

There is a pond outside, wavelings rippling across the surface, a soft, gentle,
constant wind billowing over its still mass. Two adolescent geese are floating
near the edge, wings folded, necks tall and curved like cranes, feathered chests
thrust out like a hen sitting on her eggs, enticing to the hands like a
pomeranian's coat. It is a cloudy afternoon, a uniform grey pall, bleak and gloom
looming in the skies above, time seemingly halted, the movements of the guiding
lights in abeyance, left without an announcement when early afternoon
becomes early evening. Perhaps it is the changing of the seasons. A mild chill
this morning, headwind of the winter ahead.

I am sitting in the driver's seat. My mind is frazzled, in disarray, inklings
of flickering thoughts branching in remorseless rampance, so many, so variable,
too disorganized to pursue. A sense of loss. I am driving down Douglas Road,
stuck in unusual traffic, behind an SUV stopped by a red light. I pause, shut
my eyes, take advantage of the sterile moment, hoping to quell my racing thoughts
again, this time once and for all. I had been catching up with myself all day,
tracing the lingering images, inspirations, encounters of the week which had not
yet been given due time, the weekend a reprieve from the barbarous class schedule,
being tossed between buildings and classrooms, littered with hectic meetings, to-do
lists, chaos, fragmented attention. And I had been telling myself that even on the
weekend I shouldn't lapse into rest, letting myself loosen up and breathe, that
instead I should be working. I am, after all, in graduate school. Isn't that what
I moved here for, the busyness, the urgently packed miscellanea of academic life,
a new start? When the SUV starts moving, I realize why the road is crowded: it
must be football weekend. I am on my way to J's dinner which the day before I
resolved not to attend, then considered, re-considered, settled, uprooted, a
whole series of vacillations so typical of my character, demanding routine and
predictability yet given to sudden whims and unexpected routs. My thoughts are
unstable, and I am weary from the day's brooding and pacing, the torrent unleashed
by the weekend's dam opening the floodgates of accumulated mental weight, and
pursuing each trace is tiring, a private preoccupation, the weekend in the
apartment a furnace of dilemma and quandary, sinking into contemplation after
which there is no concretized proof of progress but which leaves me relieved
and in touch with myself, a weekly rite of passage. I fret at a question that
seems to come easily to others and which is answered just as readily, in what
to them is a natural wave of the hand and which has never occurred to me as a
simple inquiry, not because I do not wish to reply, but simply because I do not
know how to answer in a way that satisfies me, much less in the immediacy of
casual small-talk: how was my weekend? What may strike others as unfruitful,
uneventful, wallowing, unhealthy, and invented difficulty are what permeate the
time I have on my own, my home life, which is difficult not only because it
does not lend itself to communication and relability, but also because it is
ethereal, lost even to myself unless I write these ruminations down. This is,
I suppose, what defines my home life, my little adventures: unpalatable difficulty.
But isn't this my default state? To step outside and mingle is easy, comforting,
relaxing, but I cannot help but be wary of its draws towards complacence,
deceptive alleviation, able to stroll in contentment for it has side-stepped the
obligatory uncertainty which, without the forces of disguising compliance, lies
in the plain. Plagued by unfinished strands of thought, an octopus' arms flailing
about, unbeknownst to anyone as always behind my serene demeanor, I had forced
myself to step out the apartment for dinner. I am driving down a road, half-baked
in the head, half-delirious, precarious in my habits, not fully re-integrated
with reality which I usually re-encounter on Monday but which I can cope with
because I know it in advance as a matter of weekly routine. The laws of nature are
difficult, but so is the human psyche. If this private, continual journey delves
further and further inwards, it is in pursuit of eventual self-discovery. We are
each of us, if given proper consideration, our own worlds waiting to be unveiled.

<h4>2019-09-23, 一. Excerpt from the little black book.</h4>
<p>
Even the presence of company somehow siphons my energy. How can this be?
It is enervating, debilitating, constraining, as if my creative latitude has
contracted, my exploratory freedom diminished. A sense of companionship gives me
at once the comfort of belonging to a group but also a group's conforming
tendencies and impulses in which my instincts are muted, not permitted to
stretch. The conversations that come closest to satisfaction are with only one
other, when I can probe deeply, one-on-one, free from a group's desultory
whims and intrusive, distracting, irrelevant itches and bouts, the inevitable
trajectory of any social engagement, yet as I am walking to class with J, as I
am sitting beside her in the lecture hall, I feel unable to be fully myself, to
linger on my doubts and uncertainties, instead irremediably exuding a calm
masquerade, putting off equanimity and poise, obeying societal prodding due to
internal proclivities I've come to realize have not entirely eroded during the
course of my asocial years but which have been lying dormant and are resurfacing
beyond my will, when the state  of affairs is that I am turbulent, restless,
excitable, and in dire need of the independence availed by solitary work. After
an accompanied episode, I have not only phased out of touch with my internal
state, having lost track of my private compass, having left my cloistered
ecosystem unattended for an interrupting duration, a black chasm gapingly torn
open, almost an unknown void between the moment I was last aware of myself and
my present disorientation, whose back-filling demands recallibration and
reflection, but I am also fatigued, aghast that my redoubled effort at
socialization competes with my very nature.
