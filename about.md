  I am a writer working on my first novel on race, family intergenerationality,
  the Asian American narrative. My intention is to write one story that's
  symbolic of the greater, universal immigrant experience, in this era and
  those prior, accessible to every American whose family at one point or another
  had borne by itself and its children the chasm over sea, over air, over land,
  a story encapsulating the experience of all those restless vagrants who've
  settled in this country or the next.

  Prose texture: Dostoyevsky's penetrating insightful depths embedded in Garcia
  Marquez's playful levity, doused in Beckett's and Camus' absurdity of the
  human condition. The taste is predominantly humorous, overlaid on the real and
  what is customarily left out of polite conversation due to idle courtesy, but
  with intermittent lapses like Ishiguro's brief window into the profound.

  I'm finishing my master's at the University of Notre Dame. Prior to this,
  I did my undergrad at NYU and then spent a few years in industry.
